# UI Test — Agentic UI Testing Skill

Test UI changes in a real browser. Your job is to **try to break things**, not confirm they work.

Three workflows:
- **Diff-driven** — analyze a git diff, test only what changed
- **Exploratory** — navigate the app, find bugs the developer didn't think about
- **Parallel** — fan out independent test groups across multiple Browserbase browsers

## How Testing Works

The main agent **coordinates** — it plans test strategy, delegates to sub-agents, and merges results. Sub-agents do the actual browser testing.

### Planning: multiple angles, then execute once

**You MUST complete all three planning rounds yourself and output them before launching any sub-agents.** Planning happens in your own response — it is NOT delegated to sub-agents. Do not skip ahead to execution.

**Round 1 — Functional:** What are the core user flows? What should work? Write out each test as: action → expected result.

**Round 2 — Adversarial:** Re-read Round 1. What did you miss? Think about: different user types/roles, error paths, empty states, race conditions, edge inputs (empty, huge, special chars, rapid clicks).

**Round 3 — Coverage gaps:** Re-read Rounds 1–2. What about: accessibility (axe-core, keyboard-only), mobile viewports, console errors, visual consistency with the rest of the app?

**Deduplicate:** Merge all three rounds into one numbered list of tests. Remove overlaps. Assign each test to a group (e.g. Group A, Group B).

**Then execute once** — launch one sub-agent per group. Each sub-agent receives its specific list of tests to run, nothing more. Sub-agents do not explore or plan — they execute assigned tests and report results.

Output the three rounds, the merged plan, and the group assignments in your response before calling any Agent tool.

### Principles for splitting work

- **Sub-agents run assigned tests, not open exploration.** The main agent hands each sub-agent a specific numbered list of tests. Sub-agents do not plan, explore, or decide what to test — they execute the list and stop.
- **The bottleneck is the slowest agent** — split work so no single agent has a disproportionate share. Many small agents > few large ones.
- **Size the effort to the change** — a single component fix doesn't need many agents or many steps. A full-page redesign does. Let the scope of the diff drive the plan.
- **No early stopping on failures** — find as many bugs as possible within the assigned tests.

### Giving sub-agents a step budget

**The main agent MUST include an explicit browse step limit in every sub-agent prompt.** Sub-agents do not self-limit — they will run until done unless told otherwise.

As a rough heuristic: ~25 steps for a few targeted checks, ~40 for a full page with functional + adversarial + a11y, ~75 for multiple pages or a broad category. **Adjust based on what the assigned tests actually require** — these are starting points, not rules.

As a rough heuristic: ~25 steps for a few targeted checks, ~40 for a full page with functional + adversarial + a11y, ~75 for multiple pages or a broad category. **Adjust based on what the assigned tests actually require** — these are starting points, not rules.

Every sub-agent prompt must include:
```
You have a budget of N browse steps (each `browse` command = 1 step). Count your steps as you go. When you reach N, stop immediately and report:
- STEP_PASS/STEP_FAIL for every test you completed
- STEP_SKIP|<test-id>|budget reached for every test you didn't get to

Do not retry or continue after hitting the budget.
Run only these tests: [numbered list from the merged plan]
Do not explore beyond the assigned tests.
Do NOT generate an HTML report or write any files. Return only step markers and your findings as text.
```

The main agent should NOT run `browse` commands itself (except to verify the dev server is up). All testing happens in sub-agents.

**When a sub-agent hits its budget, the main agent accepts the partial results as-is.** Do not re-run or retry the sub-agent. Include SKIPPED tests in the final report so the developer knows what wasn't covered.

### Reporting

**Every sub-agent reports back with:**
```
Tests: 8 | Passed: 5 | Failed: 2 | Skipped: 1 | Pages visited: 2
```

**The main agent merges into a final report with:**
```
Tests: 20 | Passed: 14 | Failed: 4 | Skipped: 2 | Agents: 3 | Pass rate: 70%
```

Do not report "steps used" — browse command counts are implementation plumbing, not a meaningful metric for reviewers.

## Testing Philosophy

**You are an adversarial tester.** Your goal is to find bugs, not prove correctness.

- **Try to break every feature you test.** Don't just check "does the button exist?" — click it twice rapidly, submit empty forms, paste 500 characters, press Escape mid-flow.
- **Test what the developer didn't think about.** Empty states, error recovery, keyboard-only navigation, mobile overflow.
- **Every assertion must be evidence-based.** Compare before/after snapshots. Check specific elements by ref. Never report PASS without concrete evidence from the accessibility tree or a deterministic check.
- **Report failures with enough detail to reproduce.** Include the exact action, what you expected, what you got, and a suggested fix.

## Assertion Protocol

Every test step MUST produce a structured assertion. Do not write freeform "this looks good."

### Step markers

For each test step, emit exactly one marker:

```
STEP_PASS|<step-id>|<evidence>
```
or
```
STEP_FAIL|<step-id>|<expected> → <actual>|<screenshot-path>
```

- `step-id`: short identifier like `homepage-cta`, `form-validation-error`, `modal-cancel`
- `evidence`: what you observed that proves the step passed (element ref, text content, URL, eval result)
- `expected → actual`: what you expected vs what you got
- `screenshot-path`: path to the saved screenshot (failures only — see Screenshot Capture below)

### Screenshot Capture for Failures

**Every STEP_FAIL MUST have an accompanying screenshot** so the developer can see what went wrong visually.

When a test step fails:

```bash
# 1. Take a screenshot immediately after observing the failure
browse screenshot --path .context/ui-test-screenshots/<step-id>.png

# If --path is not supported, take the screenshot and save manually:
browse screenshot
# The browse CLI will output the screenshot path — move/copy it:
cp /tmp/browse-screenshot-*.png .context/ui-test-screenshots/<step-id>.png
```

Setup the screenshot directory at the start of any test run:

```bash
mkdir -p .context/ui-test-screenshots
```

**Rules:**
- File name = step-id (e.g., `double-submit.png`, `axe-audit.png`, `modal-focus-trap.png`)
- Store in `.context/ui-test-screenshots/` — this directory is gitignored and accessible to the developer and other agents
- For parallel runs, include the session name: `<session>-<step-id>.png` (e.g., `signup-double-submit.png`)
- Take the screenshot at the moment of failure — capture the broken state, not after recovery
- For visual/layout bugs, also screenshot the baseline (working state) for comparison: `<step-id>-baseline.png`

### How to verify (in order of rigor)

1. **Deterministic check** (strongest) — `browse eval` returns structured data you can inspect. Examples: axe-core violation count, `document.title`, form field value, console error array, element count.
2. **Snapshot element match** — a specific element with a specific role and text exists in the accessibility tree. Check by ref: `@0-12 button "Save"`. An element either exists in the tree or it doesn't.
3. **Before/after comparison** — snapshot before action, act, snapshot after. Verify the tree changed in the expected way (element appeared, disappeared, text changed).
4. **Screenshot + visual judgment** (weakest) — only for visual-only properties (color, spacing, layout) that the accessibility tree cannot capture. Always accompany with what specifically you're evaluating.

### Before/after comparison pattern

This is the core verification loop. Use it for every interaction:

```bash
# 1. BEFORE: capture state
browse snapshot
# Record: what elements exist, their text, their refs

# 2. ACT: perform the interaction
browse click @0-12

# 3. AFTER: capture new state
browse snapshot
# Compare: what changed? What appeared? What disappeared?

# 4. ASSERT: emit marker based on comparison
# If dialog appeared: STEP_PASS|modal-open|dialog "Confirm" appeared at @0-20
# If nothing changed:
browse screenshot --path .context/ui-test-screenshots/modal-open.png
# STEP_FAIL|modal-open|expected dialog to appear → snapshot unchanged|.context/ui-test-screenshots/modal-open.png
```

## Setup

```bash
which browse || npm install -g browse
```

### Avoid permission fatigue

This skill runs many `browse` commands (snapshots, clicks, evals). To avoid approving each one, add `browse` to your allowed commands:

Add both patterns to `.claude/settings.json` (project-level) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-level):
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(browse:*)",
      "Bash(BROWSE_SESSION=*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

The first pattern covers plain `browse` commands. The second covers parallel sessions (`BROWSE_SESSION=signup browse open ...`). Both are needed to avoid approval prompts.

## Mode Selection

| Target | Mode | Command | Auth |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` | Local | `browse open <url> --local` | None needed (clean isolated local browser by default) |
| Deployed/staging site | Remote | `browse open <url> --remote` | Browserbase credentials; use contexts where supported |

**Rule: If the target URL contains `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, pass `--local` on the first `browse open`.**

### Local Mode (default for localhost)

```bash
browse open http://localhost:3000 --local
```

`browse open ... --local` uses a clean isolated local browser by default, which is best for reproducible localhost QA runs.

Use local-mode variants only when needed:

- `browse open <url> --auto-connect` — auto-discover an existing debuggable local Chrome. Use this only when the test explicitly needs existing local login/cookies/state.
- `browse open <url> --cdp <port|url>` — attach to a specific CDP target (explicit local browser attach).

### Remote Mode (deployed sites via cookie-sync)

```bash
# Step 1: Sync cookies from local Chrome to Browserbase
node .claude/skills/cookie-sync/scripts/cookie-sync.mjs --domains your-app.com
# Output: Context ID: ctx_abc123

# Step 2: Open in remote mode with the synced context
SESSION_JSON="$(browse cloud sessions create --context-id ctx_abc123 --persist --keep-alive)"
SESSION_ID="$(echo "$SESSION_JSON" | jq -r .id)"
CONNECT_URL="$(echo "$SESSION_JSON" | jq -r .connectUrl)"

browse open https://staging.your-app.com --cdp "$CONNECT_URL"
browse snapshot
# ... run tests ...
browse stop
browse cloud sessions update "$SESSION_ID" --status REQUEST_RELEASE
```

Cookie-sync flags: `--domains`, `--context`, `--verified`, `--proxy "City,ST,US"`

## Workflow A: Diff-Driven Testing

### Phase 1: Analyze the diff

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1          # or: git diff --name-only / git diff --name-only main...HEAD
git diff HEAD~1 -- <file>            # read actual changes
```

Categorize changed files:

| File pattern | UI impact | What to test |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte` | Component | Render, interaction, state, edge cases |
| `pages/**`, `app/**`, `src/routes/**` | Route/page | Navigation, page load, content, 404 handling |
| `*.css`, `*.scss`, `*.module.css` | Style | Visual appearance (screenshot), responsive |
| `*form*`, `*input*`, `*field*` | Form | Validation, submission, empty input, long input, special chars |
| `*modal*`, `*dialog*`, `*dropdown*` | Interactive | Open/close, escape, focus trap, cancel vs confirm |
| `*nav*`, `*menu*`, `*header*` | Navigation | Links, active states, routing, keyboard nav |
| Non-UI files only | None | Skip — report "no UI tests needed" |

### Phase 2: Map files to URLs

Detect framework: `cat package.json | grep -E '"(next|react|vue|nuxt|svelte|@sveltejs|angular|vite)"'`

| Framework | Default port | File → URL pattern |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Next.js App Router | 3000 | `app/dashboard/page.tsx` → `/dashboard` |
| Next.js Pages Router | 3000 | `pages/about.tsx` → `/about` |
| Vite | 5173 | Check router config |
| Nuxt | 3000 | `pages/index.vue` → `/` |
| SvelteKit | 5173 | `src/routes/+page.svelte` → `/` |
| Angular | 4200 | Check routing module |

### Phase 3: Ensure the right code is running

Before testing, verify the dev server is serving the code from the diff — not a stale branch.

**If testing a PR or specific branch:**
```bash
# Check what branch is currently checked out
git branch --show-current

# If it's not the PR branch, switch to it
git fetch origin <branch> && git checkout <branch>

# Install deps — the lockfile may differ between branches
yarn install  # or npm install / pnpm install
```

If the dev server was already running on a different branch, restart it after checkout.

**Find a running dev server:**
```bash
for port in 3000 3001 5173 4200 8080 8000 5000; do
  s=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://localhost:$port" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$s" != "000" ]; then echo "Dev server on port $port (HTTP $s)"; fi
done
```

If nothing found: tell the user to start their dev server.

**Verify it actually renders:**
After `browse open` + `browse snapshot`, check that the accessibility tree contains real page content (navigation, headings, interactive elements) — not just an error overlay or empty body. Next.js dev servers can return HTTP 200 while showing a full-screen build error dialog. If the snapshot is empty or dominated by an error dialog, the server is broken — fix the build before testing.

### Phase 4: Generate test plan

For each changed area, plan **both happy path AND adversarial tests**:

```
Test Plan (based on git diff)
=============================
Changed: src/components/SignupForm.tsx (added email validation)

1. [happy] Valid email submits successfully
   URL: http://localhost:3000/signup
   Steps: fill valid email → submit → verify success message appears

2. [adversarial] Invalid email shows error
   Steps: fill "not-an-email" → submit → verify error message appears

3. [adversarial] Empty form submission
   Steps: click submit without filling anything → verify error, no crash

4. [adversarial] XSS in email field
   Steps: fill "<script>alert(1)</script>" → submit → verify sanitized/rejected

5. [adversarial] Rapid double-submit
   Steps: click submit twice quickly → verify no duplicate submission

6. [adversarial] Keyboard-only flow
   Steps: Tab to email → type → Tab to submit → Enter → verify success
```

### Phase 5: Execute tests

```bash
browse stop 2>/dev/null
mkdir -p .context/ui-test-screenshots
# localhost/default QA → clean, reproducible local run
browse open http://localhost:3000 --local
```

For each test, follow the **before/after pattern**:

```bash
# Navigate
browse open http://localhost:3000/path --local
browse wait load

# BEFORE snapshot
browse snapshot
# Note the current state: elements, refs, text

# ACT
browse click @0-ref
# or: browse fill "selector" "value"
# or: browse type "text"
# or: browse press Enter

# AFTER snapshot
browse snapshot
# Compare against BEFORE: what changed?

# ASSERT with marker
# STEP_PASS|step-id|evidence  OR  STEP_FAIL|step-id|expected → actual
```

### Phase 6: Report results

```
## UI Test Results

### STEP_PASS|valid-email-submit|status "Thanks!" appeared at @0-42 after submit
- URL: http://localhost:3000/signup
- Before: form with email input @0-3, submit button @0-7
- Action: filled "user@test.com", clicked @0-7
- After: form replaced by status element with "Thanks! We'll be in touch."

### STEP_FAIL|double-submit|expected single submission → form submitted twice|.context/ui-test-screenshots/double-submit.png
- URL: http://localhost:3000/signup
- Before: form with submit button @0-7
- Action: clicked @0-7 twice rapidly
- After: two success toasts appeared, suggesting duplicate submission
- Screenshot: .context/ui-test-screenshots/double-submit.png
- Suggestion: disable submit button after first click, or debounce the handler

---
**Summary: 4/6 passed, 2 failed**
Failed: double-submit, xss-sanitization

Screenshots saved to `.context/ui-test-screenshots/` — open any failed step's screenshot to see the broken state.
```

Always `browse stop` when done.

### Phase 7: Generate HTML report

After producing the text report, generate a standalone HTML report that a reviewer can open in a browser. The report embeds screenshots inline (base64) so it works as a single file — no external dependencies.

**Why:** Text reports are good for the agent conversation, but reviewers (PMs, designers, other engineers) want a visual artifact they can open, scan, and share. Screenshots inline make failures immediately obvious.

#### How to generate

1. Read the HTML template at [references/report-template.html](references/report-template.html)
2. Build the report by replacing the template placeholders with actual test data:

| Placeholder | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `{{TITLE}}` | Report title for `<title>` tag (e.g., "UI Test: PR #1234 — OAuth Settings") |
| `{{TITLE_HTML}}` | Report title for the visible `<h1>`. If a PR URL is available, wrap the PR reference in an `<a>` tag so it's clickable (e.g., `UI Test: <a href="https://github.com/org/repo/pull/1234">PR #1234</a> — OAuth Settings`). If no URL, use plain text same as `{{TITLE}}`. |
| `{{META}}` | One-line context: date, app URL, user, branch |
| `{{TOTAL_TESTS}}` | Total STEP_PASS + STEP_FAIL count |
| `{{AGENT_COUNT}}` | Number of sub-agents that ran |
| `{{PASS_COUNT}}` | Number of STEP_PASS |
| `{{FAIL_COUNT}}` | Number of STEP_FAIL |
| `{{PASS_RATE}}` | Integer percentage (e.g., "92") |
| `{{RATE_CLASS}}` | `good` (≥90%), `warn` (70–89%), `bad` (<70%) |
| `{{FAILURES_SECTION}}` | HTML for failed test cards (see below) |
| `{{PASSES_SECTION}}` | HTML for passed test cards (see below) |

3. For each test result, generate a `<details>` card. Failed tests should be **open by default** so reviewers see them immediately:

```html
<!-- Failed test card (open by default) -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Failures <span class="count">{{FAIL_COUNT}}</span></h2>
  <details class="test-card fail" open>
    <summary>
      <span class="badge fail">FAIL</span>
      <span class="step-id">step-id-here</span>
      <span class="evidence">expected → actual</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="body">
      <dl>
        <dt>URL</dt><dd>http://localhost:3000/path</dd>
        <dt>Action</dt><dd>What was done</dd>
        <dt>Expected</dt><dd>What should have happened</dd>
        <dt>Actual</dt><dd>What happened instead</dd>
      </dl>
      <div class="suggestion">Fix: description of suggested fix</div>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <img src="data:image/png;base64,..." alt="Screenshot of failure">
        <div class="caption">step-id.png — captured at moment of failure</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </details>
</div>

<!-- Passed test card (collapsed by default) -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Passed <span class="count">{{PASS_COUNT}}</span></h2>
  <details class="test-card pass">
    <summary>
      <span class="badge pass">PASS</span>
      <span class="step-id">step-id-here</span>
      <span class="evidence">evidence summary</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="body">
      <dl>
        <dt>URL</dt><dd>http://localhost:3000/path</dd>
        <dt>Evidence</dt><dd>What was observed</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
  </details>
</div>
```

4. **Embed screenshots as base64** so the HTML is fully self-contained:

```bash
# Convert screenshot to base64 data URI
base64 -i .context/ui-test-screenshots/step-id.png | tr -d '\n'
# Use as: src="data:image/png;base64,<output>"
```

Read each screenshot file referenced in STEP_FAIL markers, base64-encode it, and embed it as an `<img src="data:image/png;base64,...">` in the corresponding test card. For STEP_PASS, only embed a screenshot if one was explicitly taken (e.g., baseline screenshots).

5. Write the final HTML to `.context/ui-test-report.html`:

```bash
# Write the generated HTML
cat > .context/ui-test-report.html << 'REPORT_EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
...generated report...
REPORT_EOF

# Open it for the reviewer
open .context/ui-test-report.html  # macOS
# xdg-open .context/ui-test-report.html  # Linux
```

6. Tell the user: `Report saved to .context/ui-test-report.html` and offer to open it.

**Rules:**
- Failures section comes before passes — reviewers care about what's broken first
- Failed cards are `open` by default; passed cards are collapsed
- Every STEP_FAIL card MUST have an embedded screenshot — if the screenshot file is missing, note it in the card
- Include the suggestion/fix in each failure card if one was provided
- The report must work offline — no CDN links, no external assets
- Keep the HTML under 5MB — if screenshots push it over, reduce image quality or skip baseline screenshots for passes

## Adversarial Test Patterns

Apply these to every interactive element you test. Read [references/adversarial-patterns.md](references/adversarial-patterns.md) for the full pattern library (forms, modals, navigation, error states, keyboard accessibility).

## Deterministic Checks

These produce structured data, not judgment calls. Use them as the strongest form of assertion.

| Check | What it catches | Assertion |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| axe-core | WCAG violations | `violations.length === 0` |
| Console errors | Runtime exceptions, failed requests | empty error array |
| Broken images | Missing/failed image loads | no images with `naturalWidth === 0` |
| Form labels | Inputs without accessible labels | every input has `hasLabel: true` |

For the exact `browse eval` recipes, read [references/browser-recipes.md](references/browser-recipes.md).

## Workflow B: Exploratory Testing

No diff, no plan — just open the app and try to break it. Use this when the user says "test my app", "find bugs", or "QA this site."

### Approach

1. **Discover the app** — read `package.json` to detect the framework, then open the root URL and snapshot to see what's there
2. **Navigate everything** — click through nav links, visit every reachable page, note what exists
3. **Test what you find** — for each page, apply the adversarial patterns below (forms, modals, navigation, keyboard, error states)
4. **Run deterministic checks** — axe-core, console errors, broken images, form labels on every page
5. **Report findings** — use STEP_PASS/STEP_FAIL markers, include reproduction steps for failures

Don't try to be systematic about coverage. Just explore like a user would, but with the intent to break things. The agent is good at this — let it roam.

### Tips for exploratory runs

- Start with the homepage, then follow the navigation naturally
- Try the 404 page (`/does-not-exist`) — is it custom or default?
- Look for empty states (pages with no data)
- Test forms with garbage input before valid input
- Check mobile viewport (375px) on every page — does it overflow?
- If the app has auth, use cookie-sync first

## Workflow C: Parallel Testing

Run independent test groups concurrently using named `browse` sessions (`BROWSE_SESSION=<name>`). Each session gets its own browser. Works with both local and remote mode.

Use when testing multiple pages or categories and you want faster wall clock time.

Read [references/parallel-testing.md](references/parallel-testing.md) for the full workflow: session setup, agent fan-out, cookie-sync for auth, and result merging.

## Design Consistency

Check whether changed UI matches the rest of the app visually. Read [references/design-consistency.md](references/design-consistency.md) when doing visual or design checks.

## Test Categories

| Category | How | Assertion type |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Accessibility | axe-core + keyboard nav | Deterministic (violation count) |
| Visual Quality | Screenshot + heuristic evaluation | Visual judgment (weakest — note specifics) |
| Responsive | Viewport sweep + screenshots | Visual + deterministic (overflow check) |
| Console Health | Console capture eval | Deterministic (error count) |
| UX Heuristics | Snapshot + Laws of UX + Nielsen's | Structured judgment (cite specific heuristic) |
| Error States | Navigate to empty/error states | Before/after comparison |
| Data Display | Snapshot on tables/dashboards | Element match (column count, formatting) |
| Design Consistency | Screenshot baseline + changed page comparison | Visual judgment (cite specific property) |
| Exploratory | Free navigation + adversarial testing | Before/after + judgment |

## Best Practices

1. **Be adversarial** — try to break things, don't just confirm they work
2. **Every assertion needs evidence** — snapshot ref, eval result, or before/after diff
3. **Before/after for every interaction** — snapshot, act, snapshot, compare
4. **Screenshot every failure** — `browse screenshot` immediately on STEP_FAIL, save to `.context/ui-test-screenshots/<step-id>.png`
5. **Deterministic checks first** — axe-core, console errors, form labels before visual judgment
6. **For localhost, start with clean local mode** — pass `--local` on the first `browse open` for reproducible runs; use `--auto-connect` only when existing local state is required
7. **Always `browse stop` when done** — for parallel runs, stop every named session
8. **Report failures with reproduction steps** — action, expected, actual, screenshot path, suggestion
9. **Parallelize independent tests** — use Workflow C with named sessions when testing multiple pages or categories on a deployed site

## Troubleshooting

- **"No active page"**: `browse stop`, retry. For zombies: `pkill -f "browse.*daemon"`
- **Dev server not responding**: `curl http://localhost:<port>` — ask user to start it
- **`browse eval` with `await` fails**: Use `.then()` instead — `browse eval` doesn't support top-level await
- **Element ref not found**: `browse snapshot` again — refs change on page update
- **Blank snapshot**: `browse wait load` or `browse wait selector ".expected"` before snapshotting
- **SPA deep links 404**: Navigate to `/` first, then click through
- **Remote auth fails**: Re-run cookie-sync with `--context <id>`, try `--verified`
- **Parallel session conflicts**: Ensure every `browse` command uses `BROWSE_SESSION=<name>` — without it, commands go to the default session
- **Session not stopping**: `BROWSE_SESSION=<name> browse stop`. For zombies: `pkill -f "browse.*<name>.*daemon"`
