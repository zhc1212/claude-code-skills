## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10-3.12
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required), OPENROUTER_API_KEY (optional for research lookup)

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Claude Code Plugin (Recommended) ⭐
The easiest way to use Scientific Writer is as a Claude Code plugin. See the [Plugin Installation](#-use-as-a-claude-code-plugin-recommended) section above.

#### Option 2: Install from PyPI (CLI/API Usage)
```bash
pip install scientific-writer
```

#### Option 3: Install from source with uv
```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer.git
cd claude-scientific-writer
uv sync
```

### Configure API keys
```bash
# .env file (recommended)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" > .env
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key" >> .env
# or export in your shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_key'
```

### Usage Options

#### Use as Plugin (Recommended)
After installing the plugin and running `/scientific-writer:init`, simply ask Claude:
```bash
> Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing. Present experimental_data.csv 
  (efficiency across 5 cell lines), include Western_blot.png and flow_cytometry.png 
  showing 87% editing efficiency (p<0.001). Compare with literature benchmarks.

> Generate an NSF grant proposal presenting preliminary data from quantum_results.csv 
  (99.2% gate fidelity), circuit_topology.png, and error_rates.csv. 
  Include 5-year timeline with milestones_budget.xlsx.

> @research-lookup Find papers on mRNA vaccine efficacy (2022-2024). Compare 
  with our trial_outcomes.csv (n=500, 94% efficacy) and antibody_titers.png.
```

#### Use the CLI
```bash
# If installed via pip

# If installed from source with uv
uv run scientific-writer
```

#### Use the Python API
```python
import asyncio
from scientific_writer import generate_paper

async def main():

## Plugin Testing (Local Development)

For developers working on the plugin or testing locally:

### Setup Local Marketplace

1. **Create a test marketplace** in the parent directory:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   mkdir -p test-marketplace/.claude-plugin
   ```

2. **Create marketplace configuration** (`test-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`):
   
   Copy the example from `test-marketplace-example.json` or create:
   
   ```json
   {
     "name": "test-marketplace",
     "owner": { "name": "K-Dense" },
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "claude-scientific-writer",
         "source": "../claude-scientific-writer",
         "description": "Scientific writing skills and CLAUDE.md initializer"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   
   **Note**: Update the `source` path to match your local directory structure (relative to the test-marketplace directory).

### Install and Test

3. **Add the test marketplace** in Claude Code:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add ../test-marketplace
   ```
   
   (Use the correct relative or absolute path to your test-marketplace directory)

4. **Install the plugin**:
   ```bash
   /plugin install claude-scientific-writer@test-marketplace
   ```

5. **Restart Claude Code** when prompted.

6. **Test the plugin**:
   - Open any project directory
   - Run `/scientific-writer:init`
   - Verify CLAUDE.md is created
   - Test skills: "What skills are available?"
   - Try creating a document: "Create a short scientific abstract on quantum computing"

### Verify Plugin Structure

Your plugin should have this structure:
```

```

### Troubleshooting Plugin Installation

- **Skills not showing**: Verify each `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
- **Command not working**: Check `commands/scientific-writer-init.md` exists and has proper frontmatter
- **Template not found**: Ensure `templates/CLAUDE.scientific-writer.md` is present
- **Marketplace not loading**: Verify `marketplace.json` syntax and relative path to plugin

- [📋 Release Notes](CHANGELOG.md) - Version history and updates
- [🤖 System Instructions](CLAUDE.md) - Agent instructions (advanced)

## Versioning and Publishing (short)
Use `uv` and the helper scripts:
- Bump version (keeps pyproject + __init__ in sync): `uv run scripts/bump_version.py [patch|minor|major]`
- Build and publish: `uv run scripts/publish.py` (or `--bump patch|minor|major`)
See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for prerequisites, dry runs, tagging, and verification.

## Migration (v1.x -> v2.0)
- CLI remains unchanged (scientific-writer).
- New programmatic API: from scientific_writer import generate_paper.
- Legacy single-file script is replaced by a proper package; no action needed for CLI users.
