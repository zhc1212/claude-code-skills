### Current Version: v2.43.0

| Version | Highlights |
|---------|------------|
| **v2.43.0** | **CONTRIBUTING.md + OpenCode docs fix + `.continue`/`.gemini`/`.kiro` variant sync to parity** (PR #171 by @Skulli485, issue #172 by @luyanfeng, issues #159/#160/#161): first `CONTRIBUTING.md` at repo root, auto-surfaced by GitHub in the PR creation flow. `docs/opencode.md` Quick Install switched from \`git clone\` to \`npx skills add\` after the manual-install block was found referencing a doubled path (`planning-with-files/planning-with-files/SKILL.md`). Three historically lagging IDE SKILL.md variants brought to v2.43.0 parity: `.continue` from v2.34.0 (9 versions behind), `.gemini` from v2.34.0 (9 versions behind), `.kiro` from v2.32.0-kiro (11 versions behind), preserving IDE-specific frontmatter, hook shapes, and Kiro Agent Skill layout. |
| **v2.42.0** | **POSIX `init-session.sh` portability + plugin-vs-skill install transparency + Topic Handoff docs** (PR #169 and PR #170 by @carterusedulm2-maker): `init-session.sh` and its 7 mirrors swap the `[[ ]]` bashism for POSIX `[ ]` so `tests/test_init_session_slug.py` runs cleanly under `dash` (Ubuntu) when the test invokes the script via `sh` rather than the `bash` shebang. Canonical SKILL.md gains an install-scope clarification: `/plugin install` ships the `commands/` folder with `/plan-goal` and `/plan-loop`, but `npx skills add` (and ClawHub) do not. A manual fallback procedure for both wrappers is documented inline so skill-only sessions can produce the same effect by invoking Claude Code's native `/goal` and `/loop` primitives directly. `docs/quickstart.md` and `docs/workflow.md` add an optional Topic Handoff Pattern for very long-running operational topics (`handoffs/<topic>.md` alongside `progress.md`). |
| **v2.41.0** | **Windows exec-bit test skip + attestation-locking docs** (PR #167 by @gauravvojha, Issue #166; PR #168 by @CleanDev-Fix, Issue #165): `test_script_permissions.py` now skips on Windows with a class-level `pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32")` since NTFS does not store POSIX executable bits; the 2 pre-existing Windows exec-bit failures (present since v2.34.1) are resolved. New dedicated `docs/attestation-locking.md` page documents the `attest-plan.sh` write path, the atomic temp-rename guarantee, the optional `flock` advisory lock, and the recommended slug-mode workflow for parallel sessions. |
| **v2.40.1** | **Pi adapter SKILL.md sync gap + npm scope correction** (PR #158 by @TomXPRIME): the `.pi` SKILL.md lagged the canonical Claude Code copy after v2.39.0; v2.40.1 backports Rule 7 (Continue After Completion), the Security Boundary section, the expanded Scripts section covering `set-active-plan.sh`/`resolve-plan-dir.sh`/`attest-plan.sh` plus the parallel task workflow, and the "Write web content to task_plan.md" anti-pattern row. The Pi npm package is renamed from the unscoped `pi-planning-with-files` to `@tomxprime/planning-with-files`, matching the package author's namespace; install docs updated accordingly. Author, repository, license, and bugs URLs preserved. |
| **v2.40.0** | **Slug-mode resolution fixes + perf cache + KV-cache hygiene + Pi false-positive fix** (9 items from the v2.40 R&D experiment): hook resolution order inverted so slug-mode wins over legacy root, `.active_plan` target dir + content validated against a safe-identifier regex, `check-complete.sh` honors `$PLAN_ID` and `.active_plan`, Pi extension `isDangerousBashCommand` swapped to a word-boundary regex array so benign `git push origin <branch>` no longer fires the warning, mtime-keyed SHA-256 cache cuts attestation-hook latency on Windows Git Bash, `progress.md` tail timestamps normalized for KV-cache prefix stability, `resolve-plan-dir.sh` mtime resolution made portable across GNU/BSD/macOS/Alpine/Git Bash with python+perl fallbacks, `attest-plan.sh` uses atomic temp-rename with optional `flock` to close the concurrent-writer race. 130 pass / 2 pre-existing Windows exec-bit fails, +20 new tests. |
| **v2.39.0** | **Pi Coding Agent full hook parity extension + Codex hooks flag fix** (PR #157 by @TomXPRIME, Issue #154 by @DLI1996): the `.pi` adapter ships a bundled TypeScript extension mapping eight Pi lifecycle events to the same behavior the skill provides on Claude Code, with a four-mode system (`auto`/`parity`/`cache-safe`/`notify`) that auto-detects DeepSeek and keeps the KV-cache prefix stable. Pi runtime reads the same `.attestation` file the canonical v2.37 `attest-plan.sh` writes, so attesting once locks the plan across both runtimes. Four slash commands (`/plan-status`, `/plan-attest`, `/plan-goal`, `/plan-loop`) mirror their Claude Code counterparts. Separately, `docs/codex.md` swaps from `codex_hooks = true` to `hooks = true` to match the current OpenAI canonical key, with an alias note so users on older configs are not pushed to migrate. |
| **v2.38.1** | **Description field garbled in Claude Code skill picker** (surfaced via Discussion #153 by @bmyury): hook commands embedded `'---BEGIN PLAN DATA---'` plan-injection delimiters; Claude Code's skill-discovery loader split frontmatter on the first `---` and read the truncated value as the description. Swapped to `===BEGIN PLAN DATA===` / `===END PLAN DATA===` across canonical SKILL.md, all five language variants, the `.codebuddy/.codex/.cursor` adapter mirrors, and `clawhub-upload`. Hook execution and tamper attestation never affected; only the displayed metadata. |
| **v2.38.0** | **Claude Code turn-loop integration + OpenCode SQLite fix**: new PreCompact hook fires on `/compact` and autoCompact, surfaces a reminder to flush progress before compaction completes and prints the active Plan-SHA256 when attested. New `/plan-goal` slash command composes with Claude Code's `/goal` (v2.1.139, May 12 2026): derives a termination condition from the active plan. New `/plan-loop` composes with `/loop` (v2.1.72+): default 10-minute tick re-reads planning files and runs check-complete. New `templates/loop.md` for the bare `/loop` planning-aware default. Session-catchup rewritten for OpenCode's SQLite migration. Codex gets a `PermissionRequest` adapter that surfaces plan context at permission prompts. |
| **v2.37.0** | **Hash attestation + parity bumper** (closes #150, #151): `/plan-attest` locks `task_plan.md` with a SHA-256; hooks block injection on tamper. `scripts/bump-version.py` + parity test kill the "missed one variant" regression class behind v2.34.1, v2.36.0, v2.36.2, and v2.36.3. (thanks @oaabahussain!) |
| **v2.36.3** | **Parallel planning scripts now ship in the skill**: `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `set-active-plan.sh` were missing from the installed skill in v2.36.0; now in canonical + all IDE mirrors + SKILL.md docs updated |
| **v2.36.2** | **Canonical script sync** (PR #149): `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/init-session.sh` was missing slug mode from v2.36.0; now synced with IDE mirrors + regression test. (thanks @voidborne-d!) |
| **v2.36.1** | **Security hardening**: Stop hook cache search removed, ExecutionPolicy Bypass changed to RemoteSigned, prompt injection delimiters added. (Gen Agent Trust Hub FAIL resolved) |
| **v2.36.0** | **Parallel plan isolation + Codex session isolation** (closes #146, #148): `init-session.sh` slug mode, `set-active-plan.sh`, `resolve-plan-dir.sh`, all Codex hooks route through resolver, session attachment gating. **Hermes docs** (closes #147): integration notes added to `docs/hermes.md`. 34 new tests. (thanks @githubYiheng, @09ashishkapoor, @shawnli1874!) |
| **v2.35.1** | **Shebang portability fix**: changed `/bin/bash` to `/usr/bin/env bash` in hook scripts, fixing compatibility on NixOS and other systems where bash is not at `/bin/bash`. (thanks @Emin017!) |
| **v2.35.0** | **Hermes adapter + NLPM audit hardening**: Hermes platform 17 support (thanks @bailob!), NLPM audit fixed Python PATH resolution, session-catchup injection cap, Pi PowerShell syntax (thanks @xiaolai!) |
| **v2.34.1** | **Stop hook Windows portability fix** (closes #133): `export SD=` failed in Windows Git Bash hook context; fallback path was wrong for plugin cache structure. Fixed across all 13 SKILL.md variants. (thanks @nazeshinjite!) |
| **v2.34.0** | **Codex hooks fully restored** (closes #132): `.codex/hooks.json` + lifecycle scripts back — SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop. Tessl CI for SKILL.md quality reviews. Exec bit fix. 4 missing contributors added. (thanks @Leon-Algo, @popey!) |

### Session Recovery

When your context fills up and you run `/clear`, this skill **automatically recovers** your previous session.

**How it works:**
1. Checks for previous session data in the active IDE's session store (`~/.claude/projects/` for Claude Code, `~/.codex/sessions/` for Codex)
2. Finds when planning files were last updated
3. Extracts conversation that happened after (potentially lost context)
4. Shows a catchup report so you can sync

**Pro tip:** Disable auto-compact to maximize context before clearing:
```json
{ "autoCompact": false }
```

<summary><strong>🔧 Claude Code Plugin (Advanced Features)</strong></summary>

For Claude Code-specific features like `/plan` autocomplete commands:

```
/plugin marketplace add OthmanAdi/planning-with-files
/plugin install planning-with-files@planning-with-files
```

</details>

That's it! Now use one of these commands in Claude Code:

| Command | Autocomplete | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `/planning-with-files:plan` | Type `/plan` | Start planning session (v2.11.0+) |
| `/planning-with-files:status` | Type `/plan:status` | Show planning progress at a glance (v2.15.0+) |
| `/planning-with-files:start` | Type `/planning` | Original start command |

**Alternative:** If you want `/planning-with-files` (without prefix), copy skills to your local folder:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cp -r ~/.claude/plugins/cache/planning-with-files/planning-with-files/*/skills/planning-with-files ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\plugins\cache\planning-with-files\planning-with-files\*\skills\planning-with-files" -Destination "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\"
```

See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for all installation methods.

## Why This Skill?

On December 29, 2025, [Meta acquired Manus for $2 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/). In just 8 months, Manus went from launch to $100M+ revenue. Their secret? **Context engineering**.

> "Markdown is my 'working memory' on disk. Since I process information iteratively and my active context has limits, Markdown files serve as scratch pads for notes, checkpoints for progress, building blocks for final deliverables."
> — Manus AI

## The Problem

Claude Code (and most AI agents) suffer from:

- **Volatile memory** — TodoWrite tool disappears on context reset
- **Goal drift** — After 50+ tool calls, original goals get forgotten
- **Hidden errors** — Failures aren't tracked, so the same mistakes repeat
- **Context stuffing** — Everything crammed into context instead of stored

## The Solution: 3-File Pattern

For every complex task, create THREE files:

```
task_plan.md      → Track phases and progress
findings.md       → Store research and findings
progress.md       → Session log and test results
```

### The Core Principle

```
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

→ Anything important gets written to disk.
```

## The Manus Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Filesystem as memory | Store in files, not context |
| Attention manipulation | Re-read plan before decisions (hooks) |
| Error persistence | Log failures in plan file |
| Goal tracking | Checkboxes show progress |
| Completion verification | Stop hook checks all phases |

## Usage

Once installed, the AI agent will:

1. **Ask for your task** if no description is provided
2. **Create `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md`** in your project directory
3. **Re-read plan** before major decisions (via PreToolUse hook)
4. **Remind you** to update status after file writes (via PostToolUse hook)
5. **Store findings** in `findings.md` instead of stuffing context
6. **Log errors** for future reference
7. **Verify completion** before stopping (via Stop hook)

Invoke with:
- `/planning-with-files:plan` - Type `/plan` to find in autocomplete (v2.11.0+)
- `/planning-with-files:start` - Type `/planning` to find in autocomplete
- `/planning-with-files` - Only if you copied skills to `~/.claude/skills/`

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for the full 5-step guide.

## Benchmark Results

Formally evaluated using Anthropic's [skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator) framework (v2.22.0). 10 parallel subagents, 5 task types, 30 objectively verifiable assertions, 3 blind A/B comparisons.

| Test | with_skill | without_skill |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Pass rate (30 assertions) | **96.7%** (29/30) | 6.7% (2/30) |
| 3-file pattern followed | 5/5 evals | 0/5 evals |
| Blind A/B wins | **3/3 (100%)** | 0/3 |
| Avg rubric score | **10.0/10** | 6.8/10 |

## Key Rules

1. **Create Plan First** — Never start without `task_plan.md`
2. **The 2-Action Rule** — Save findings after every 2 view/browser operations
3. **Log ALL Errors** — They help avoid repetition
4. **Never Repeat Failures** — Track attempts, mutate approach

## When to Use

**Use this pattern for:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research tasks
- Building/creating projects
- Tasks spanning many tool calls

**Skip for:**
- Simple questions
- Single-file edits
- Quick lookups
