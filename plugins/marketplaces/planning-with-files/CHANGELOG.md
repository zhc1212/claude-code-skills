# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.43.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **CONTRIBUTING.md at repo root** (PR #171 by @Skulli485, closes issue #162): first-time contributor guide covering local setup, project layout, PR submission conventions, authorship and credit policy, language variant contribution rules, and where to ask questions. Pre-merge follow-up commit removed a duplicated intro and a broken code fence that the original diff carried. GitHub auto-surfaces the file in the PR creation flow now.

### Fixed

- **OpenCode docs broken install/verify paths** (Issue #172 by @luyanfeng): `docs/opencode.md` referenced `planning-with-files/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` (doubled folder segment) in the manual-install block, the `cat` usage block, and both verification `ls` commands. The path assumed a full-repo clone into the skills directory rather than a direct file copy of the `.opencode/skills/planning-with-files/` subtree. v2.43.0 replaces the manual-install Quick Install with `npx skills add` (matching every other IDE doc) and rewrites the manual-install and verification commands so the path resolves to the single-level location where the skill actually lands. OpenCode session-catchup note updated to point at the SQLite store path the v2.38.0 rewrite introduced, replacing the stale "Full ... support is planned for a future release" line.

- **`.continue` variant SKILL.md sync gap from v2.34.0 to v2.43.0** (Issue #159): nine versions behind canonical. v2.43.0 ports Rule 7 (Continue After Completion), the Security Boundary section with delimiter framing and hash attestation, the expanded Scripts section listing `init-session.sh`/`set-active-plan.sh`/`resolve-plan-dir.sh`/`check-complete.sh`/`session-catchup.py`/`attest-plan.sh` plus the parallel task workflow block, the "Write web content to task_plan.md" Anti-Pattern row, and the 5-Question Reboot Test. Continue-specific items preserved: `.continue/skills/...` script paths, session-catchup invocation shape. The v2.34.0 Security Boundary table removed (canonical version supersedes it with delimiter/attestation coverage). File grew from 92 to 179 lines.

- **`.gemini` variant SKILL.md sync gap from v2.34.0 to v2.43.0** (Issue #160): nine versions behind canonical. v2.43.0 ports the same canonical content as `.continue` plus the parallel task workflow and 5-Question Reboot Test. Gemini-specific items preserved: `hooks: "Configured in .gemini/settings.json (SessionStart, BeforeTool, AfterTool, BeforeModel)"` metadata key. The Claude-specific Turn-Loop Integration section is omitted because Gemini CLI has no `/plan-goal`, `/plan-loop`, or `PreCompact` hook primitive; the Gemini-specific Security Boundary section references Gemini lifecycle hooks instead. File grew from 179 to 199 lines.

- **`.kiro` variant SKILL.md sync gap from v2.32.0-kiro to v2.43.0-kiro** (Issue #161): eleven versions behind canonical. v2.43.0 ports Rule 7, the expanded Scripts section (bootstrap, session-catchup, check-complete), the Anti-Patterns table, and the 5-Question Reboot Test. Kiro-specific items preserved: `metadata.integration: kiro` field, Agent Skill layout, `compatibility:` frontmatter key, STEP 0/1/2/3 structure, `.kiro/steering/` references, `#[[file:.kiro/plan/…]]` live references, and `assets/scripts/` path convention. Version kept as `2.43.0-kiro` per the original suffix convention.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.43.0 across 17 parity-locked files via `scripts/bump-version.py`. The three lagging variants (`.continue`, `.gemini`, `.kiro`) were synced manually in this release; `.pi` remains intentionally on the npm scheme (`1.1.0` in `package.json`) per AGENTS.md.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass, 2 skip (Windows exec-bit, pre-existing baseline since v2.34.1), 0 fail. PR #171 adds markdown only; the v2.43.0 fix for `docs/opencode.md` touches no executable paths; `.continue`, `.gemini`, and `.kiro` SKILL.md rewrites are read by the model at runtime, not parsed by the test suite. The parity test (`test_skill_md_version_parity.py`) continues to validate the 17-file parity set without drift.

### Thanks

- @Skulli485 for the CONTRIBUTING.md draft (PR #171), first contribution to the repo.
- @luyanfeng for reporting the OpenCode docs path bug (issue #172), first contribution to the repo.

## [2.42.0] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **POSIX `init-session.sh` portability across the 8 mirrors** (PR #169 by @carterusedulm2-maker): the script's shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, but `tests/test_init_session_slug.py:27` invokes it via `["sh", str(INIT_SH), *args]` which bypasses the shebang and runs the body under whatever `sh` resolves to. On Ubuntu and Debian where `/bin/sh` is `dash`, the `while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]` bashism failed with a syntax error before any slug-mode argument parsing could run. v2.42.0 swaps to POSIX `while [ $# -gt 0 ]` in the 8 mirrored copies: `scripts/init-session.sh` (top level), `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/init-session.sh` (canonical), and the `.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.continue`, `.factory`, `.gemini`, `.pi` adapter copies. Behavior is identical under bash; the change only restores compatibility under dash so the slug-mode test suite runs portably.

### Added

- **Install-scope transparency block in canonical `SKILL.md`** (Turn-Loop Integration section). Documents which install route ships which surface: `/plugin install` includes the `commands/` folder with `/plan-goal` and `/plan-loop`, but `npx skills add` (and ClawHub) install only the contents of `skills/planning-with-files/` and therefore do not register the wrapper slash commands. The `PreCompact` hook is registered in the SKILL.md frontmatter and works for both routes. Also notes the `disable-model-invocation: true` interaction tracked in upstream issues anthropics/claude-code #26251 and #41417, where some Claude Code sessions refuse to execute the slash command even when the user types it directly.
- **Manual fallback procedure** for `/plan-goal` and `/plan-loop` inline in the canonical `SKILL.md`. The procedures mirror what the `commands/plan-goal.md` and `commands/plan-loop.md` files would have fed the model when invoked: resolve the active plan, compose the goal condition or loop tick prompt, then issue Claude Code's native `/goal` or `/loop` primitive (always available, not plugin-scoped). Lets skill-only installs and sessions affected by the disable-model-invocation refusal pattern produce the same effect by following the steps inline.

### Docs

- **Topic Handoff Pattern documentation in `docs/quickstart.md` and `docs/workflow.md`** (PR #170 by @carterusedulm2-maker): documents an optional convention for splitting unrelated topics across `.planning/<slug>/` directories or a manual `handoffs/<topic>.md` detail layer alongside `progress.md`. The pattern is documentation-only; no shipped script reads `handoffs/`. Recommended for long-running operational topics that span multiple sessions, where keeping `progress.md` concise as a timeline index and putting durable detail (current state, commands, validation, risks, rollback, PR links) in a per-topic handoff file is easier to navigate after a `/clear`.
- **README releases table row for v2.42.0** plus version badge bumped to 2.42.0.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.42.0 across 17 parity-locked files (14 SKILL.md variants plus `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff`) via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally per AGENTS.md release scope.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass, 2 skip (Windows exec-bit, pre-existing baseline since v2.34.1), 0 fail. PR #169 changes shell-only string syntax across mirrored scripts; PR #170 adds markdown only. Neither touches hooks, attestation, the resolver, or any script-execution path. Security audit completed 2026-05-25 (see `.planning/2026-05-25-security-audit/findings.md`): semgrep 0 findings, no preinstall/postinstall hooks anywhere, no remote fetches, SLUG_RE path-traversal defense parity confirmed across the 14 SKILL.md variants.
- Web research basis for the transparency block: Anthropic skill docs at `code.claude.com/docs/en/skills` confirm that prompt-based slash commands are the blessed Claude Code pattern (matches bundled skills like `/loop`, `/goal`, `/run`, `/verify`, `/debug`). Quote: "Unlike most built-in commands, which execute fixed logic directly, bundled skills are prompt-based: they give Claude detailed instructions and let it orchestrate the work using its tools." The `commands/` and `skills/` directories are now unified per Anthropic: "Custom commands have been merged into skills." Plugin scope still distinguishes installation surface from `npx skills add`.

### Thanks

- @carterusedulm2-maker for both the POSIX init-session compatibility fix (PR #169) and the Topic Handoff workflow documentation (PR #170). Both filed on 2026-05-25, first contributions to the repo.

## [2.41.0] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **Windows POSIX exec-bit tests now skip on NTFS** (PR #167 by @gauravvojha, Issue #166): `test_script_permissions.py` relied on POSIX executable bits which NTFS does not preserve. The two tests in the `CanonicalScriptPermissionsTests` class (`test_shell_scripts_are_executable`, `test_session_catchup_is_executable`) ran fine on Linux and macOS but always failed on Windows with `mode: 0o100666`. v2.41.0 adds a class-level `@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32")` decorator so the tests skip cleanly on Windows while still running on POSIX file systems. The upstream PR patch introduced a malformed duplicate standalone function at module scope and a nested method inside it; the fix was corrected to class-level granularity during merge.
- **Post-merge test-file repair** (follow-up to PR #167): the squash-merged patch from PR #167 left `tests/test_script_permissions.py` in a broken state at `ed43a71`. The standalone-function duplicate and nested class method were removed, imports re-sorted, and the class-level `pytest.mark.skipif` re-applied correctly. No test logic changed.

### Added

- **`docs/attestation-locking.md`**: new documentation page covering the `scripts/attest-plan.sh` write path, the atomic temp-rename correctness guarantee, the optional `flock` advisory lock, a platform behavior table (Linux, macOS, Windows Git Bash, WSL), and the recommended slug-mode workflow for parallel sessions. Linked from the canonical `SKILL.md` Security Boundary section for discoverability. (PR #168 by @CleanDev-Fix, Issue #165)

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.41.0 across 17 parity-locked files (14 SKILL.md variants plus `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff`) via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally per AGENTS.md release scope.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass, 2 skip (Windows exec-bit tests), 0 fail. PR #167 touches only `tests/test_script_permissions.py`; PR #168 adds `docs/attestation-locking.md` plus a two-line SKILL.md link. Neither PR touches hook bodies, canonical scripts, or the attestation mechanism.

### Thanks

- @gauravvojha for reporting the Windows exec-bit failure in Issue #166 and supplying the first-pass fix in PR #167.
- @CleanDev-Fix (CleanFix-Dev) for the attestation-locking documentation in PR #168, which closes Issue #165.

## [2.40.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Pi adapter SKILL.md sync gap** (PR #158 by @TomXPRIME): the `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` variant lagged the canonical Claude Code copy after v2.39.0 shipped. Four pieces of surface were missing on Pi: Rule 7 (Continue After Completion) covering multi-cycle plan extension when the user requests additional work, the Security Boundary section documenting the BEGIN/END delimiter framing plus the v2.37 hash attestation defense layers, the expanded Scripts section covering `set-active-plan.sh`, `resolve-plan-dir.sh`, `attest-plan.sh`, and the parallel task workflow, and the "Write web content to task_plan.md" anti-pattern row. v2.40.1 backports all four items so Pi users get the same instruction surface as Claude Code users. The redundant manual session-catchup instruction in the Pi SKILL.md is removed because the Pi extension shipped in v2.39.0 handles that lifecycle event automatically.
- **Pi npm package scope correction** (PR #158): `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/package.json` `name` field was set to the unscoped `pi-planning-with-files`. Tom owns the npm publishing chain for the Pi package; the unscoped form had ownership ambiguity. v2.40.1 renames to `@tomxprime/planning-with-files`, matching the package author's npm namespace. Author "Ahmad Othman Ammar Adi", repository URL, license, and bugs URL are preserved. No new dependencies, no preinstall or postinstall scripts, no new bin entries, no new files; only the `name` field changed.
- **Pi install docs updated** (PR #158): `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/README.md` install command updated to `pi install npm:@tomxprime/planning-with-files`. The manual install section is rewritten to use `pi install ./.pi/skills/planning-with-files` (local path) or a `.pi/settings.json` `packages` entry, replacing the previous "copy the folder into your skills dir then `/reload`" prose. SKILL.md cross-references updated to match.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.40.1 across the 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally per CLAUDE.md release scope.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass / 2 pre-existing Windows exec-bit failures (test_script_permissions, unchanged from v2.40.0 and unrelated to this release). PR #158 changes the Pi adapter doc surface and `package.json` `name`; the Pi extension TypeScript runtime, hook bodies, and canonical Claude Code surface are not touched. Safety audit on the PR confirmed no supply-chain attack vectors: no new dependencies, no install hooks, no bin shims, no new files, author and repository metadata preserved.

### Thanks

- @TomXPRIME: second contribution after the Pi full hook parity extension in v2.39.0. The Pi adapter is now actively maintained by its author, with the npm publishing chain pointing at his scoped namespace and the SKILL.md surface kept in sync with the canonical Claude Code copy.

## [2.40.0] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **Hook resolution order inverted: slug-mode now wins over legacy root** (item #1 in `proposal_v2_40.md`). Before v2.40, every hook body in `SKILL.md` checked `if [ -f task_plan.md ]` at the project root FIRST and only consulted `.planning/.active_plan` for attestation lookup, never for content lookup. When both a root `task_plan.md` and a slug-mode plan existed, the root plan silently won and the user's explicitly-active slug plan was bypassed. v2.40 rewrites the resolution chain across `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, and `PreCompact` so they consult `$PLAN_ID` env, then `.planning/.active_plan`, then newest `.planning/<slug>/` by mtime, and only fall back to root `task_plan.md` if no slug-mode plan resolves. Legacy single-file users keep working; parallel-plan users get the plan they actually pinned.
- **`.active_plan` target dir validated before use** (item #2). If `.active_plan` content points to a deleted plan dir, the hook used to silently no-op because the outer `if [ -f task_plan.md ]` only checked root. v2.40 falls through to the newest-mtime resolution path, then root, instead of leaving the model with no context.
- **`.active_plan` content validated against a safe-identifier regex** (item #3). `tr -d '[:space:]'` normalized whitespace-only content to an empty string, which the hook then concatenated into `.planning//task_plan.md` (an empty plan id). v2.40 enforces `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$` on both `$PLAN_ID` env and `.active_plan` content, so corruption (whitespace, path traversal like `../escape`, leading-dot dotfile names) falls through to the next resolution step instead of producing weird path lookups.
- **`check-complete.sh` honors `$PLAN_ID` and `.active_plan`** (item #4). The Stop hook passed `.planning/$AP/task_plan.md` explicitly so the bug was silent there, but any user invocation or third-party tooling that called `check-complete.sh` with no args saw "No task_plan.md found" even with an active slug plan. v2.40 wires the script into `resolve-plan-dir.sh` when no explicit path argument is passed, restoring slug-mode parity. Behavior with an explicit path argument is unchanged.
- **Pi extension dangerous-command list uses word-boundary regex** (item #5). `runtime.ts` `isDangerousBashCommand` used substring matching against a flat list including `"git push"`. Every benign `git push origin <branch>` fired the warning, training users to ignore it. v2.40 replaces the substring list with a `DANGEROUS_BASH_PATTERNS` regex array: `\brm\s+-[a-z]*r[a-z]*f\b`, `\bsudo\b`, `\bchmod\s+(0?777|a\+rwx)\b`, `\bgit\s+push\s+.*(--force|-f\b|--mirror|\+)`, `\bgit\s+reset\s+--hard\b`, `\bgit\s+clean\s+-[a-z]*[fdx]`, a shell fork-bomb pattern, and `\bdd\s+.*of=/dev/[sh]d[a-z]`. Benign `git push` no longer triggers the notify; only destructive variants do.

### Performance

- **mtime-keyed SHA-256 cache in attestation hook** (item #6). Each `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` hook previously ran a fresh `sha256sum` on `task_plan.md` to compare against the stored attestation. On Windows Git Bash this is ~800ms per fire dominated by bash spawn and disk I/O; over a 60-event session that is ~48 seconds of cumulative latency. v2.40 caches the result under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pwf-sha/<key>` keyed by the absolute plan-file path, storing `mtime` and the hash. On the next fire, if the plan file's mtime is unchanged, the cached hash is reused without re-running `sha256sum`. The cache is per-system, transient, and invalidated automatically by any plan edit.
- **KV-cache hygiene on injected progress.md tail** (item #7). The Manus-aligned auto-injection feature is most valuable when the Claude / Sonnet / Opus prefix cache stays warm across turns. The previous injection embedded the literal `tail -20 progress.md`, including sub-second timestamps and timezone-suffix forms that change every fire. Those bytes mid-prefix prevented cache reuse. v2.40 pipes the tail through `sed -E` to normalize `T<HH:MM:SS>(.<frac>)?Z` and `T<HH:MM:SS>(.<frac>)?(+|-)HH:MM` to a stable `T00:00:00Z` / `T00:00:00<TZ>` form before injection. The model still sees recent progress structure; only the volatile sub-fields are collapsed.

### Portability

- **`resolve-plan-dir.sh` uses portable mtime fallback chain** (item #19). The old `date -r FILE +%s || stat -c '%Y' FILE || echo 0` chain silently fell to `0` on systems lacking GNU coreutils (some Windows Git Bash builds, alpine busybox, restricted CI containers). When mtime resolves to `0` for every dir in `.planning/*/`, the newest-by-mtime resolution becomes order-dependent on directory listing rather than actual recency. v2.40 extends the chain to: GNU `stat -c '%Y'`, BSD `stat -f '%m'`, `date -r FILE +%s`, `python3 -c ... os.stat`, `python -c ... os.stat`, `perl -e ... (stat $f)[9]`, then `0`. The earlier paths cover GNU + BSD + macOS + Windows Git Bash + Alpine + WSL; the python/perl fallbacks cover everything else with a runtime cost only paid when the native shell tools are absent.
- **`attest-plan.sh` uses atomic temp-rename with optional `flock` guard** (item #20). Concurrent legacy-mode attestations (two sessions in the same cwd with no `PLAN_ID`) used to race on a non-atomic `> .plan-attestation` redirect, occasionally producing a truncated or zero-length attestation that the hook then read as the expected hash and threw a false `[PLAN TAMPERED]` on the next prompt. v2.40 writes to a `.plan-attestation.tmp.<pid>` and renames into place, with `flock -w 5` around the rename when `flock` is available. The atomic-rename guarantee is the real fix; the flock is the cooperative gate against multi-writer disk-stall edge cases. The script also surfaces a one-line note when legacy-mode attestation activity is detected within 30 seconds of a prior write, pointing users to slug-mode for parallel sessions.

### Verification

- Test count: 130 pass / 2 pre-existing Windows exec-bit failures (test_script_permissions, unchanged from v2.39.0 and unrelated to this release). +20 new tests vs v2.39.0: 5 in `tests/test_resolve_plan_dir.py` covering corruption + dead-target + invalid-slug-scan, 5 in `tests/test_check_complete_resolver.py` covering the resolver wire-up, 1 concurrent-writer test in `tests/test_plan_attestation.py`, 1 word-boundary contract test in `tests/test_pi_extension_capabilities.py`, 8 hook-body behavioral tests in `tests/test_hook_body_v240.py` covering slug-beats-root, legacy-root, silent no-plan, corrupt-active-plan fall-through, SHA cache population, tamper-still-blocks, progress-timestamp normalization, and PreToolUse injection.
- Hook body now ~3.2 KB single-line bash per event (up from ~1 KB in v2.39.0). Same idiom as the existing inline pattern. Long-term extract to `scripts/inject-plan-context.sh` is tracked as v2.41-class work in `proposal_v2_40.md`.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.40.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally.

### Not changed (deliberate)

- No brainstorm-before-plan gate (item #8 in `proposal_v2_40.md`). Deferred to a later release because it changes user-facing workflow shape and deserves its own focused cycle.
- No new sidecar files (`decisions.md`, `lessons.md`, `await_approval.md`, dispatch queue, checkpoints). All deferred to v2.41 or v3.0 per the proposal.
- No refactor of the canonical hook body into a dedicated script (item #17). The inline pattern is preserved; the new logic ships within the same single-line idiom. This is acknowledged as maintenance debt and tracked for v2.41.

## [2.39.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Pi Coding Agent full hook parity extension** (PR #157 by @TomXPRIME): the `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/` adapter previously shipped only the markdown skill, with a docs note that hook-style automation was Claude Code specific and not available on Pi. v2.39.0 ships a bundled TypeScript extension under `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/extensions/planning-with-files/` that maps Pi lifecycle events onto the same behavior the skill provides on Claude Code. Event surface: `session_start` runs session catchup, `before_agent_start` injects plan context, `tool_call` adds pre-tool recitation, `tool_result` appends the post-write reminder to write/edit outputs, `agent_end` auto-continues incomplete plans (limit 3 per session+plan), `session_before_compact` flushes the plan reminder with the active `Plan-SHA256`, `session_shutdown` clears loop timers and per-session state, `input` resets the auto-continue counter on user activity. The extension declares itself via `pi.extensions` in `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/package.json` so `pi install npm:pi-planning-with-files` auto-loads it.
- **Pi mode system** (PR #157): four modes select how the extension talks to the model. `auto` (default) reads the active model's provider plus id, picks `cache-safe` when DeepSeek is detected, picks `parity` otherwise. `parity` reproduces the full Claude-style dynamic injection (plan content varies per fire). `cache-safe` swaps the dynamic content for fixed reminder strings so the DeepSeek KV-cache prefix stays stable across turns. `notify` surfaces the reminder via `ctx.ui.notify` only, never adds tokens to the model input. Configurable via `PWF_MODE` env var, project `.pi/settings.json`, or global `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` under the `planningWithFiles.mode` key.
- **Pi attestation gate** (PR #157): the Pi extension reads the same `.planning/<active-plan>/.attestation` file the canonical v2.37 `attest-plan.sh` writes. On every hook fire it recomputes the SHA-256 of `task_plan.md` and compares against the stored hash. On mismatch the extension blocks injection and emits the `[PLAN TAMPERED]` warning with the expected and actual hashes plus the path to re-approve. Source of truth is shared with Claude Code, so attesting once locks the plan across both runtimes.
- **Pi slash commands** (PR #157): four commands registered through `pi.registerCommand` mirror their Claude Code counterparts. `/plan-status` prints active plan path, scope, phase totals. `/plan-attest [--show|--clear]` runs the canonical attest helper (`.ps1` on Windows, `.sh` on POSIX), surfacing the result through `ctx.ui.notify`. `/plan-goal <text|default|clear>` sets a termination criterion that the auto-continue path appends to its prompt; `default` resolves to the canonical "all phases complete" condition. `/plan-loop [interval] [prompt|stop]` sets up a `setInterval` tick that re-reads the plan and nudges progress, with `stop` and `session_shutdown` both clearing the timer.
- **`.pi/skills/planning-with-files/package.json`**: declares the new `pi.extensions` array, adds `peerDependencies` for `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, bumps the npm scheme to `1.1.0` to reflect the extension surface addition (npm scheme remains independent of the canonical 2.x version).
- **`docs/cache-safe-diagram.md`**: ASCII diagram showing how cache-safe mode keeps the KV-cache prefix stable across turns for DeepSeek and other prefix-sensitive models.
- **`tests/test_pi_extension_packaging.py`** (3 tests): asserts the `.pi` package.json declares `pi.extensions`, the extension entrypoint exists, and the extension directory carries all required source files.
- **`tests/test_pi_extension_capabilities.py`** (5 tests): asserts the runtime registers the four documented commands, declares all eight expected event handlers, and exposes the documented mode enum.
- **`tests/test_pi_docs_hook_support.py`** (4 tests): asserts the Pi docs no longer carry the "hooks are Claude Code specific" disclaimer, the SKILL.md surface lists the new commands, and the README documents the mode system.

### Fixed

- **Codex `[features]` flag name** (Issue #154 by @DLI1996): `docs/codex.md` instructed users to add `codex_hooks = true` under `[features]` in `~/.codex/config.toml`. OpenAI updated the canonical Codex hooks docs (developers.openai.com/codex/hooks) to make `hooks` the canonical key and `codex_hooks` a deprecated alias. v2.39.0 swaps the docs to `hooks = true` in four sites (introductory callout, the "Enable Hooks in config.toml" code block plus its follow-up prose, and the troubleshooting checklist), and adds a one-line note in each spot that `codex_hooks = true` still works as a deprecated alias so users on older configs are not pushed to migrate. Verification command updated to `rg '^(hooks|codex_hooks)\s'`.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.39.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally; `.pi` carries its own npm scheme bump (1.0.1 to 1.1.0) inside `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/package.json` for the extension surface addition.

### Verification scope

- Python contract tests (110 pass, 2 pre-existing Windows exec-bit fails unrelated to this release) cover the Pi extension's packaging, declared event surface, declared command surface, and documentation. The TypeScript runtime itself runs only when loaded by a live Pi Coding Agent process. Behavior under Pi was validated by the PR author; no CI runtime test exists for the Pi extension code path. Pi-specific regressions should be filed as new issues against `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/extensions/`.

### Thanks

- @TomXPRIME for the Pi full hook parity extension (PR #157). Lifecycle event mappings, mode system, attestation gate, four slash commands, and 12 contract tests, iterated through PRs #155 and #156 to land code-only in #157.
- @DLI1996 for catching the Codex `[features]` flag drift against OpenAI's canonical docs (Issue #154).

## [2.38.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Description field garbled in Claude Code skill picker** (surfaced by @bmyury via Discussion #153): the canonical SKILL.md frontmatter declares hooks inline as YAML scalars. Several of those scalars contain `'---BEGIN PLAN DATA---'` and `'---END PLAN DATA---'` as plan-injection delimiters (introduced in v2.36.1, reinforced in v2.37 attestation). Frontmatter parsers that split on the literal string `---` to locate the closing fence read the first `---` inside a hook command as the fence, truncating the YAML mid-string. Claude Code's skill-discovery loader behaves this way, so the description shown in the in-product skill list was a fragment of the hook command tail (`BEGIN PLAN DATA---'; head -50 task_plan.md...`) instead of the documented description. Real YAML parsers handled the frontmatter correctly, so hook execution and tamper attestation were never affected; only the displayed metadata was wrong. v2.38.1 swaps the delimiter shape from `---BEGIN PLAN DATA---` / `---END PLAN DATA---` to `===BEGIN PLAN DATA===` / `===END PLAN DATA===` across the canonical SKILL.md, all five language variants, the `.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.cursor` adapter mirrors, and the `clawhub-upload` bundle. Same delimiter shape, same model-side framing semantics; the `===` substring does not collide with YAML's document separator.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.38.1 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally.
- Pre-existing line-ending drift in IDE adapter mirrors (`examples.md`, `attest-plan.sh`, `attest-plan.ps1` under `.codex`, `.cursor`, `.gemini`, `.opencode`, `.pi`) normalized to LF via `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py`. 12 files touched, content identical to canonical.

### Thanks

- @bmyury for surfacing the description display bug via Discussion #153.

## [2.38.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **PreCompact hook**: a new hook event fires on Claude Code's autoCompact and manual `/compact`. When `task_plan.md` is present, the hook surfaces a reminder to flush in-context progress to `progress.md` before compaction completes, and prints the active `Plan-SHA256` if an attestation is set. Added to the canonical SKILL.md plus all five language variants plus `clawhub-upload`. Other IDE mirrors fall back to their pre-existing compaction-related hooks (Codex `/compact` callback, OpenCode `session.compacted`, Hermes `pre_llm_call`) until per-IDE PreCompact adapters land in a later release.
- **`/plan-goal` slash command**: composes with Claude Code's new `/goal` primitive (v2.1.139, May 12 2026). Derives a goal condition from the active plan (`all phases in task_plan.md report Status: complete`) and forwards it to `/goal` so the agent keeps working until the plan-file is genuinely done, not just when the conversation looks done. Plan-loop and plan-goal are intentionally composable: cadence + termination criterion.
- **`/plan-loop` slash command**: composes with Claude Code's `/loop` primitive (v2.1.72+). Default 10-minute tick re-reads the planning files, runs `check-complete`, and nudges an entry into `progress.md` if nothing has changed since the last tick. Override interval and prompt as you would with bare `/loop`.
- **`templates/loop.md`**: a planning-aware default prompt users can copy into `.claude/loop.md` (project) or `~/.claude/loop.md` (user) so bare `/loop` runs grounded in the active plan. `/loop` only reads these two paths; copy is required, not auto-wired.
- **OpenCode SQLite session catchup**: the skill's session-catchup script reads OpenCode's new SQLite store at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/opencode/opencode.db` (sst/opencode dev @ 2026-05-14, schema: `session(id, directory, time_created, ...)` + `part(id, session_id, time_created, data TEXT JSON)`). The previous JSON-tree reader silently no-op'd for every OpenCode user since the storage migration. Now opens the DB read-only via URI (`file:<path>?mode=ro`), scopes by `session.directory`, and surfaces the most recent unsynced planning-file edits with the same UX as the Claude Code path. Defensive `PRAGMA table_info` probe degrades cleanly on schema migrations. Verified end-to-end against a real 162 MB OpenCode database on the development machine (94 sessions, correctly extracted 56 unsynced parts from a session with planning-file edits).
- **Codex `PermissionRequest` adapter**: Codex added a `PermissionRequest` hook event for tool-permission prompts. The new `.codex/hooks/permission_request.py` adapter surfaces a one-line reminder to review `task_plan.md` before approving a request, when an active plan is present. Session-attachment gated (legacy default-on, isolation opt-in). Read-only; never blocks the request.
- **SKILL.md body documentation**: a new "Claude Code Turn-Loop Integration (v2.38.0+)" section documents the PreCompact hook, `/plan-goal`, `/plan-loop`, and the `loop.md` template install. Surfaces v2.38 features in user-facing prose, not only frontmatter.
- **`clawhub-upload/` full sync**: the ClawHub upload bundle had drifted from canonical somewhere around v2.32 (missing slug-mode, set-active-plan, resolve-plan-dir, attest-plan scripts, BEGIN/END injection delimiters, hash attestation hook bodies). Re-synced from canonical so the manual ClawHub upload reflects current v2.38 state.
- **`tests/test_precompact_hook.py`** (6 tests): asserts the PreCompact hook is declared with a wildcard matcher, stays silent without `task_plan.md`, emits the reminder when the plan exists, surfaces `Plan-SHA256` only when an attestation file is set, and exits 0 on every code path.
- **`tests/test_v238_command_files.py`** (7 tests): asserts `commands/plan-goal.md`, `commands/plan-loop.md`, and `templates/loop.md` exist, carry the expected frontmatter, document the `/goal` 4000-char limit, and reference all three planning files.
- **`tests/test_session_catchup_opencode.py`** (4 tests): builds a synthetic `opencode.db` matching the live schema, asserts the catchup function finds the most recent planning-file edit, stays silent when no plan edit is present, and degrades silently when the DB is missing.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.38.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, `.kiro` lag intentionally.
- Canonical session-catchup script propagated to `.codebuddy`, `.codex`, `.continue`, `.factory`, `.gemini`, `.opencode`, `.pi` via `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py`.

### Not changed (deliberate)

- **No `paths` glob restriction in the canonical SKILL.md frontmatter.** The Claude Code spec now supports a `paths` field that filters auto-invocation to matching file types. Adding it would silently change auto-invocation behavior for the existing install base. Deferred to a later release with explicit signal data.
- **No bulk replacement of inline hook bodies with `!command` substitution.** That substitution runs at skill-load time, not per hook fire. Wholesale swap would freeze the SHA-256 attestation hash at load time and silently disable v2.37's tamper-detection gate. Inline hook bodies retained for per-fire runtime checks.
- **No native Plan Mode panel integration.** Claude Code's April 14 2026 desktop redesign added a Plan Mode panel with Approve/Reject flow, but no plugin/skill API is publicly documented for rendering plans into that panel. Tracked for a future release.
- **No language variant consolidation.** Issue #130 (consolidate into a single skill with locale parameter) is a separate breaking change and is not bundled into this release. The five locale-specific variants continue to ship.

## [2.37.0] - 2026-05-05

### Security

- **Hash attestation for plan injection** (Issue #150 by @oaabahussain): `task_plan.md` content is auto-injected into the model context on every UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse fire. v2.36.1 added BEGIN/END delimiters, but the model still parses the bytes. v2.37.0 adds an opt-in second layer: run `/plan-attest` (or `sh scripts/attest-plan.sh`) once a plan is finalised. The script computes a SHA-256 of `task_plan.md` and stores it at `.planning/<active-plan>/.attestation` (parallel-plan mode) or `./.plan-attestation` (legacy mode). On every hook fire, the inline check recomputes the hash and compares. On mismatch, injection is blocked and the model receives `[planning-with-files] [PLAN TAMPERED — injection blocked]` instead of plan content. When attestation is set, the injected context also carries a `Plan-SHA256:` line so the model can log the attested hash for audit. Opt-in: absence of an attestation file preserves the v2.36.x behavior.

### Added

- **`/plan-attest` slash command**: thin wrapper around `attest-plan.sh` with `--show` (print the stored hash) and `--clear` (re-open the plan to free editing).
- **`scripts/attest-plan.sh` and `scripts/attest-plan.ps1`**: SHA-256 attestation helper for both POSIX shell and Windows PowerShell. Resolves the active plan via the same `$PLAN_ID` / `.active_plan` / newest-mtime / legacy chain used by the rest of the skill.
- **`scripts/bump-version.py`** (Issue #151 by @oaabahussain): atomic version bumper for the parity-locked file set (14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `CITATION.cff`). Replaces 17 hand edits with one `python scripts/bump-version.py X.Y.Z`. Prevents the "missed one variant" regression class that hit v2.34.1, v2.36.0, v2.36.2, and v2.36.3. `.continue`, `.gemini`, `.pi`, and `.kiro` are intentionally excluded (separate version schemes); the script lists them at the end of every run so the omission stays visible.
- **`tests/test_skill_md_version_parity.py`** (Issue #151): four assertions that fail the build the moment any parity-locked file diverges from the canonical SKILL.md version. Catches drift in CI before it can ship.
- **`tests/test_plan_attestation.py`**: six tests covering legacy and parallel-plan attestation, `--show`, `--clear`, tamper detection, and missing-plan handling.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate test class in `tests/test_canonical_script_sync.py`**: a leftover second copy of `CanonicalScriptSyncTests` (lines 99 to 137) was running the same assertions twice. Removed.

### Changed

- **Security Boundary section in canonical SKILL.md**: now documents the two layers of defense (delimiters + attestation) and adds an explicit rule recommending `/plan-attest` after finalising a plan.
- **`scripts/sync-ide-folders.py`**: SCRIPTS manifest now includes `attest-plan.sh` and `attest-plan.ps1`. The eight pre-existing scripts are unchanged.
- **`tests/test_canonical_script_sync.py`**: `SHARED_SCRIPTS` extended to ten entries (added `attest-plan.sh` and `attest-plan.ps1`). The regression test now covers all user-facing scripts.
- Version bumped to 2.37.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff` via `scripts/bump-version.py`.

### Thanks

- @oaabahussain for two thoughtful, well-scoped P1 reports: Issue #150 turned the v2.36.1 delimiter mitigation into a verifiable cryptographic guarantee, and Issue #151 named the regression class behind four consecutive releases and proposed the right surgical fix.

## [2.36.3] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **Missing parallel planning scripts in canonical skill copy**: `resolve-plan-dir.sh`, `resolve-plan-dir.ps1`, `set-active-plan.sh`, and `set-active-plan.ps1` were added to `scripts/` in v2.36.0 but never propagated to `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/` or the IDE mirror folders. Users installing via `npx skills add` could not use the v2.36.0 parallel planning workflow because the key scripts were not shipped in the install. Same class of gap as PR #149.
- **`sync-ide-folders.py` manifest incomplete**: the sync manifest only listed the original five scripts and did not include the four new v2.36.0 scripts. Running the sync tool after this release propagates all nine user-facing scripts to all IDE mirrors.
- **`test_canonical_script_sync.py` did not cover new scripts**: the SHARED_SCRIPTS tuple in the regression test from PR #149 only listed the original four scripts. Updated to include all eight user-facing scripts that must stay in sync between `scripts/` and `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/`.

### Added

- **Parallel planning documentation in SKILL.md**: the Scripts section now documents `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `set-active-plan.sh` with usage descriptions and a parallel task workflow example showing how to use slug mode, `set-active-plan.sh`, and `export PLAN_ID` together.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.36.3 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff`

## [2.36.2] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **Canonical skill copy missing slug-mode init-session** (PR #149 by @voidborne-d): `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/init-session.sh` and `init-session.ps1` were not updated when slug mode shipped in v2.36.0. Users installing via `npx skills add` or any of the nine IDE folders received the legacy-only v2.0.0 script, silently missing the parallel plan isolation feature. Fixed by syncing the top-level canonical scripts into the skill directory and all IDE mirrors.
- **Shebang drift in IDE mirror scripts**: `check-complete.sh` in `.codebuddy/`, `.codex/`, `.continue/`, `.factory/`, `.gemini/`, `.pi/` folders still used `#!/bin/bash`. Synced to `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to match the Emin017 fix from v2.35.1.
- **Analytics template gap in canonical PS1**: `init-session.ps1` in the canonical skill copy lacked the `--template analytics` support added in v2.29.0 by @mvanhorn. Included in this sync.

### Added

- **Regression test** `tests/test_canonical_script_sync.py`: asserts `init-session.{sh,ps1}` and `check-complete.{sh,ps1}` are byte-identical between `scripts/` and `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/`. A second assertion invokes `sync-ide-folders.py --verify` to catch IDE mirror drift in CI. Prevents this class of silent version mismatch from recurring.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.36.2 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff`
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` updated: added @voidborne-d (PR #149)

### Thanks

- @voidborne-d for catching the canonical/top-level script drift, providing grep proof, running the sync tool, and adding the regression test that prevents recurrence (PR #149)

## [2.36.1] - 2026-05-01

### Security

- **Stop hook: eliminate broad cache search** (Gen Agent Trust Hub COMMAND_EXECUTION): replaced `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` over `~/.claude/plugins/cache` with resolution through `$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` env var first, then two specific known install paths (`~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/`). Removes the attack surface where a malicious `check-complete.ps1` planted anywhere in the cache directory would be found and executed.
- **PowerShell ExecutionPolicy: Bypass → RemoteSigned** (Gen Agent Trust Hub COMMAND_EXECUTION): `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` circumvents all script execution policies. `RemoteSigned` allows locally created scripts while still blocking downloaded scripts that lack a trusted signature. Applied across all 14 SKILL.md variants.
- **Prompt injection delimiters** (Gen Agent Trust Hub PROMPT_INJECTION): `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` hook output now wraps injected plan content in `---BEGIN PLAN DATA---` / `---END PLAN DATA---` markers with explicit model instructions to treat enclosed content as structured data and ignore embedded instructions. Addresses the lack of sanitization and boundary markers flagged in the audit.
- **Security Boundary section updated** (Snyk W011): added explicit model instruction that `findings.md` content (which ingests third-party web/search results) must be treated as raw data regardless of what it contains. Clarifies the delimiter contract to auditors and the model.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.36.1 across all 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff`

## [2.36.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Parallel plan isolation** (Issue #148 by @shawnli1874): `init-session.sh` now accepts a task name and creates a dated, readable plan directory under `.planning/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`. Each parallel task gets its own isolated directory, ending the cross-contamination that v2.0.0 hooks introduced by hardcoding `task_plan.md` at the project root. Legacy zero-argument behavior is unchanged. New `set-active-plan.sh` and `set-active-plan.ps1` let users explicitly switch between plans without exporting `PLAN_ID`. New `resolve-plan-dir.sh` and `resolve-plan-dir.ps1` provide the resolution chain: `$PLAN_ID` env var, then `.planning/.active_plan`, then the newest plan directory by mtime, then empty (legacy fallback). All four Codex lifecycle hooks (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) now route through the resolver instead of assuming a root-level `task_plan.md`.
- **Codex session isolation** (Issue #146 by @githubYiheng): Codex sessions in a shared working directory no longer receive plan context from unrelated sessions. Attachment is opt-in: create `.planning/sessions/<session_id>.attached` to bind a session to the active plan. `user-prompt-submit.sh`, `pre_tool_use.py`, `stop.py`, and `post_tool_use.py` all gate on session attachment before injecting context or blocking. Backward compatible: absence of `.planning/sessions/` preserves existing single-session behavior.
- **Hermes integration notes** (Issue #147 by @09ashishkapoor): `docs/hermes.md` gains an `Integration Notes` section that separates what the adapter provides today from what is not full parity with hook-native platforms. Covers current support level, recommended integration pattern, and a tradeoffs table. Reduces confusion for users migrating from Claude Code hook workflows.
- **34 new tests**: `tests/test_resolve_plan_dir.py` (7), `tests/test_init_session_slug.py` (6), `tests/test_hook_resolver_integration.py` (10), `tests/test_codex_session_isolation.py` (5), `tests/test_set_active_plan.py` (6).

### Fixed

- **`resolve_latest_dir` skips non-plan directories**: auto-discovery previously matched any subdirectory under `.planning/`, including the new `sessions/` directory. It now requires `task_plan.md` to be present, preventing session isolation from silently breaking when both features are active.
- **`short_uuid()` bypasses Windows App Execution Aliases**: the function now probes each Python candidate with a test run before trusting `command -v`, avoiding the case where the Windows Store alias reports presence but exits non-zero.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.36.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `CITATION.cff`
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` updated: added @githubYiheng (Issue #146), @09ashishkapoor (Issue #147), @shawnli1874 (Issue #148); total count now 39+

### Thanks

- @githubYiheng for tracing the session boundary problem down to its exact code path and proposing the session attachment model (Issue #146)
- @09ashishkapoor for the clear documentation gap report and the four-section structure that made writing the fix straightforward (Issue #147)
- @shawnli1874 for the detailed parallel workflow breakdown, the concrete reproduction case, and the slug naming proposal that shaped the final design (Issue #148)

## [2.35.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Hermes adapter** (PR #136 by @bailob): new `.hermes/skills/planning-with-files/` bundle, `.hermes/plugins/planning-with-files/` Python adapter, `/plan` and `/plan-status` command wrappers, and `docs/hermes.md` install guide. The adapter registers three tools (`planning_with_files_init`, `planning_with_files_status`, `planning_with_files_check_complete`) plus `pre_llm_call` and `post_tool_call` hooks that mirror the Claude Code hook behavior. Hermes is now platform 17. The PR ships 20 unit tests in `tests/test_hermes_adapter.py` covering status parsing, reminder behavior, installation layout, and completion checks.
- **NLPM audit coverage** (Issue #140 by @xiaolai): static audit of all 25 natural language artifacts, overall score 91/100, zero Critical or High findings. The three verified bugs were filed as separate PRs and merged below.

### Fixed

- **Pi PowerShell session-catchup syntax error** (PR #137 by @xiaolai, closes part of #140): `.pi/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` had a missing opening `"` before the script path in the Windows PowerShell invocation, causing a parse error that silently killed session catchup for Pi users on Windows. Quote restored to balance the closing `"`.
- **Session-catchup context injection now bounded** (PR #138 by @xiaolai, closes part of #140): `.github/hooks/scripts/session-start.sh` piped unbounded `session-catchup.py` output into `additionalContext`, meaning content from a prior session (web results, tool output) could reach the current model context unlabeled and without size limit. Output now passes through `head -100` and is prefixed with `[planning-with-files] Previous session context (truncated to 100 lines):` so the model knows the content is historical.
- **Hook scripts prefer known Python paths** (PR #139 by @xiaolai, closes part of #140): `session-start.sh`, `pre-tool-use.sh`, and `error-occurred.sh` resolved the Python interpreter entirely from the user's PATH. The three scripts now try `/usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/local/bin/python3`, and `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` before falling back to `command -v python3`, closing a PATH hijack vector without changing behavior on systems that expose Python at those canonical paths.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.35.0 across 14 SKILL.md variants, plugin.json, marketplace.json, and CITATION.cff
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` updated: added @bailob (PR #136, major contribution) and @xiaolai (PRs #137, #138, #139, Issue #140); total count now 36+
- plugin.json description now says "17+ AI coding assistants" and keywords include `hermes`

### Thanks

- @bailob for the Hermes adapter, full test coverage, and the `/plan` and `/plan-status` command wrappers (PR #136)
- @xiaolai for the NLPM audit sweep and three coordinated hardening PRs (PR #137, PR #138, PR #139, Issue #140)

## [2.34.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- **Stop hook portability failure on Windows Git Bash** (closes #133, reported by @nazeshinjite) — Two independent bugs caused the Stop hook to silently fail on Windows 11 with Git Bash inside Command Prompt: (1) `export SD=` was treated as an external command rather than a shell builtin in certain Windows Git Bash invocation contexts, producing `bash: export: No such file or directory`; (2) the fallback path `$HOME/.claude/plugins/planning-with-files` never exists — the actual install location is `~/.claude/plugins/cache/planning-with-files/planning-with-files/VERSION/`. Fixed across all 13 SKILL.md variants (Claude Code, Codex, CodeBuddy, Cursor, Factory, Mastra Code, OpenCode, all language variants). Claude Code variants now use PowerShell self-discovery via `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` with `~` home expansion (no bash variable needed) and a glob-based sh fallback against the correct cache path. All other IDE variants have `export SD=` replaced with `SD=`.

## [2.34.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Codex hooks restored** (closes #132) — `.codex/hooks.json` and `.codex/hooks/` scripts are back. Codex users now get the same full lifecycle hook automation as Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot users: SessionStart runs session catchup and injects plan context; UserPromptSubmit re-injects on every message; PreToolUse re-reads task_plan.md before Bash; PostToolUse reminds the agent to update progress.md; Stop blocks when phases are incomplete then re-prompts. These files were present in v2.31.0 (PR #120 by @Leon-Algo) but were accidentally wiped when master was rewritten during v2.32.0 — now fully restored.
- **Codex hook regression test** (`tests/test_codex_hooks.py`) — 4 test cases covering hooks.json structure, SessionStart context injection, PreToolUse systemMessage emission, PostToolUse progress reminder, and Stop block-then-allow behavior
- **Tessl skill-review-and-optimize CI** (PR #131 by @popey) — `.github/workflows/skill-review.yml` runs on every PR that touches a SKILL.md, posts scores and AI-suggested improvements as a PR comment; `.github/workflows/skill-optimize-apply.yml` lets contributors type `/apply-optimize` to commit the suggestions directly. Non-blocking by default.

### Fixed

- **Canonical shell scripts not executable** (PR #122 by @Leon-Algo) — `skills/planning-with-files/scripts/check-complete.sh` and `init-session.sh` were tracked as `100644` instead of `100755`, breaking Codex and any Unix installer that depends on the executable bit. Fixed to `100755`. Regression test added.
- **Duplicate `version:` key in Codex SKILL.md** — `.codex/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` had two `version: "2.33.0"` entries in the metadata block (same bug fixed for zh/zht in a previous commit but missed here). Deduplicated.
- **Codex docs updated** — `docs/codex.md` rewritten to cover both skills and hooks installation, hooks protocol explanation, workspace vs personal install, and troubleshooting for duplicate hook messages and Windows limitations.

### Changed

- **CONTRIBUTORS.md updated** — Added @Leon-Algo (PRs #119, #120, #122), @YSAA1 (PR #109), @kevinaimonster (PR #108), @wd041216-bit (PR #107); updated @lasmarois entry to include PR #37; bumped total count to 32+

### Thanks

- @Leon-Algo for the Codex hooks design, three separate fix PRs, and patience while the master rewrite wiped his work (PR #119, #120, #122)
- @popey (Alan Pope) for the Tessl CI workflow (PR #131)

## [2.33.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Multi-language expansion** — New skill variants for international users:
  - Arabic (`planning-with-files-ar`) - Full Arabic localization with proper RTL support
  - German (`planning-with-files-de`) - Complete German localization  
  - Spanish (`planning-with-files-es`) - Comprehensive Spanish localization
  - Enhanced Simplified Chinese (`planning-with-files-zh`) - Fully localized scripts and templates
  - Enhanced Traditional Chinese (`planning-with-files-zht`) - Refined localization
- **New command files** for all languages: `plan-ar.md`, `plan-de.md`, `plan-es.md`
- **International installation commands** added to README with language-specific examples
- **Global keyword support** in plugin metadata for better discoverability

### Fixed

- **Simplified Chinese script localization** — All scripts now properly display Chinese messages instead of English
- **Arabic template consistency** — Template and scripts now use consistent Arabic phase headers (`### المرحلة`) and state labels (`**الحالة:**`)
- **Spanish template consistency** — Template and scripts now use consistent Spanish state labels (`**Estado:**`)
- **Stop hook path corrections** — All language variants now use correct paths in Stop hooks

## [2.32.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Codex session catchup** (PR #124 by @ebrevdo) — `session-catchup.py` now reads Codex rollout JSONL from `~/.codex/sessions`, prefers `CODEX_THREAD_ID` when skipping the current thread, filters subagent and tiny sessions, and detects planning-file updates from structured Codex `patch_apply_end` events
- **Loaditout security badge** (PR #126, closes #123) — Added A-grade security badge to README (top 20.5% of 20,000+ MCP servers scanned)

### Fixed

- **Stop hook fails on Windows Git Bash (MSYS2)** (PR #126, closes #125)
  - Root cause: MSYS2 treats bare `SD="/c/Users/..."` as a command to execute rather than a variable assignment
  - Fix: changed `SD="..."` to `export SD="..."` across all 9 SKILL.md variants (Claude Code, Codex, CodeBuddy, Cursor, Factory, Gemini, Mastra Code, OpenCode, + zh/zht)

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.32.0 across all 12 SKILL.md files, plugin.json, marketplace.json, and CITATION.cff

### Thanks

- @ebrevdo (Eugene Brevdo) for the Codex session catchup rewrite (PR #124)

## [2.29.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Analytics workflow template** (PR #115 by @mvanhorn, addresses #103)
  - New `--template analytics` flag on `init-session.sh` and `init-session.ps1`
  - `templates/analytics_task_plan.md` with 4 analytics-specific phases: Data Discovery, Exploratory Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Synthesis
  - `templates/analytics_findings.md` with Data Sources table, Hypothesis Log, Query Results, and Statistical Findings sections
  - Analytics-specific `progress.md` generates a Query Log table instead of Test Results
  - Default behavior unchanged; existing users are not affected

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/init-session.sh --template analytics my-project
```

### Thanks

- @mvanhorn (Matt Van Horn) for implementing the analytics template that @sedlukha requested in #103

---

## [2.28.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) skill variant** (PR #113 by @waynelee2048)
  - Fully translated SKILL.md, templates, and scripts under `skills/planning-with-files-zht/`
  - Localized hooks, check-complete, init-session, and session-catchup scripts

### Thanks

- @waynelee2048 for the Traditional Chinese translation

---

## [2.27.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Kiro Agent Skill support** (PR #112 by @EListenX)
  - Full `.kiro/skills/planning-with-files/` layout with SKILL.md, bootstrap scripts, templates, references
  - Bootstrap creates `.kiro/plan/` for planning files and `.kiro/steering/planning-context.md` with `#[[file:]]` live references
  - Includes session-catchup.py and check-complete scripts adapted for Kiro's `.kiro/plan/` path
  - Replaces the old `.kiro/scripts/` and `.kiro/steering/` approach with proper Agent Skill format

### Changed

- Updated `scripts/sync-ide-folders.py` to skip `.kiro` (Kiro uses its own skill layout)
- Rewrote `docs/kiro.md` to reflect new Agent Skill approach

### Thanks

- @EListenX (Yi Chenxi) for the thorough Kiro integration with proper Agent Skill format

## [2.23.0] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **Session catchup not working after `/clear`** (Issue #106 by @tony-stark-eth)
  - Root cause: No hook fired on session start to remind the agent about existing planning files. After `/clear`, the agent started fresh with no awareness of the active plan.
  - Added `UserPromptSubmit` hook across all 7 IDE SKILL.md files. When `task_plan.md` exists, the hook injects a directive to read all three planning files before proceeding. This fires on every user message, ensuring the agent always knows about active plans even after `/clear` or context compaction.
  - Strengthened SKILL.md "FIRST" section: now explicitly says to read all three files immediately, not just run session catchup.

- **Progress not updating consistently** (Issue #106)
  - Root cause: `PostToolUse` hook message only mentioned `task_plan.md`, never `progress.md`. The agent was never reminded to log what it did.
  - Changed PostToolUse message across all 7 IDE SKILL.md files and both Copilot hook scripts to lead with "Update progress.md with what you just did."
  - Added `if [ -f task_plan.md ]` guard so the reminder only fires when a plan is active.

- **Post-plan additions not tracked** (Issue #106)
  - Root cause: When all phases were complete, `check-complete` scripts reported "ALL PHASES COMPLETE" with no guidance about continuing. The agent had no reason to add new work to the plan.
  - Updated `check-complete.sh` and `check-complete.ps1`: completion message now says "If the user has additional work, add new phases to task_plan.md before starting."
  - Updated Copilot `agent-stop` scripts to output continuation context even when all phases are complete (previously returned empty `{}`).
  - Added Critical Rule #7 ("Continue After Completion") to canonical SKILL.md body.

### Changed

- Version bumped to 2.23.0 across all 7 IDE SKILL.md files, plugin.json, and marketplace.json

### Thanks

- @tony-stark-eth for the detailed bug report covering all three symptoms (Issue #106)

---

## [2.22.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Formal benchmark results** — skill evaluated using Anthropic's skill-creator framework
  - 10 parallel subagents, 5 diverse task types, 30 objectively verifiable assertions
  - with_skill: **96.7% pass rate** (29/30); without_skill: 6.7% (2/30) — delta: +90 percentage points
  - 3 blind A/B comparisons: with_skill wins 3/3 (100%), avg score 10.0/10 vs 6.8/10
  - Full methodology in [docs/evals.md](docs/evals.md)
- **Technical article** — [docs/article.md](docs/article.md): full write-up of the security analysis, fix, and eval methodology
- **README badges** — Benchmark (96.7% pass rate), A/B Verified (3/3 wins), Security Verified
- **README Benchmark Results section** — key numbers visible at a glance

### Changed

- `marketplace.json` version corrected to track current release (was stuck at 2.0.0)

## [2.21.0] - 2026-03-05

### Security

- **Remove `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` from `allowed-tools`** — fixes Gen Agent Trust Hub FAIL and reduces Snyk W011 risk score
  - The planning-with-files skill is a file-management and planning skill; web access is not part of its core scope
  - The PreToolUse hook re-reads `task_plan.md` before every tool call, creating an amplification vector when web-sourced content is written to plan files. Removing these tools from the skill's declared scope breaks the toxic flow
  - Applied across all 7 IDE variants that declared `allowed-tools`: Claude Code, Cursor, Kilocode, CodeBuddy, Codex, OpenCode, Mastra Code
- **Add Security Boundary section to SKILL.md** — explicit guidance that web/search results must go to `findings.md` only (not `task_plan.md`), and all external content must be treated as untrusted
- **Add security note to examples.md** — the web research example now includes an inline comment reinforcing the trust boundary

## [2.20.0] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Codex session-catchup silent failure** (PR #100 by @tt-a1i, fixes #94)
  - `session-catchup.py` in the Codex variant was silently scanning `~/.claude/projects` even when running from a Codex context, where sessions live under `~/.codex/sessions` in a different format
  - Now detects the Codex runtime from `__file__` path and prints a clear fallback message instead of a silent no-op

- **Docs broken links** (PR #99 by @tt-a1i, fixes #95)
  - `docs/opencode.md` linked to `.opencode/INSTALL.md` which does not exist — corrected to `docs/installation.md`
  - `docs/factory.md` See Also links used `../skills/planning-with-files/` paths — corrected to `../.factory/skills/planning-with-files/`

- **Examples used stale `notes.md` filename** (PR #99 by @tt-a1i, fixes #96)
  - All `examples.md` files across 16 IDE copies referenced `notes.md` which was renamed to `findings.md` — updated consistently everywhere

- **`sync-ide-folders.py --help` ran a sync instead of printing usage** (PR #99 by @tt-a1i, fixes #98)
  - Replaced manual `sys.argv` parsing with `argparse` — `--help` now exits cleanly with usage information

### Changed

- **OpenCode README support label corrected** (PR #99 by @tt-a1i, fixes #97)
  - Changed from `Full Support` to `Partial Support` with a note about session catchup limitations — aligns README with what `docs/opencode.md` actually says

### Thanks

- @tt-a1i for the full consistency sweep (PR #99, PR #100)

---

## [2.19.0] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- **Codex Advanced Topics broken links** (PR #92 by @tt-a1i, fixes #91)
  - Corrected two dead links in `.codex/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md`
  - `reference.md` → `references/reference.md`
  - `examples.md` → `references/examples.md`

### Thanks

- @tt-a1i for identifying and fixing the broken Codex links (PR #92)

---

## [2.18.3] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Stop hook multiline YAML command fails under Git Bash on Windows** (PR #86 by @raykuo998)
  - Root cause: YAML `command: |` multiline blocks are not reliably parsed by Git Bash on Windows. The shell received the first line (`SCRIPT_DIR=...`) as a command name rather than a variable assignment, crashing the hook before it could do anything.
  - Replaced 25-line OS detection scripts with a single-line implicit platform fallback chain: `powershell.exe` first, `sh` as fallback. Applied to all 7 SKILL.md variants with Stop hooks.
  - Added `-NoProfile` to PowerShell invocation for faster startup

- **`check-complete.ps1` completely failing on PowerShell 5.1** (PR #88 by @raykuo998)
  - Root cause: Special characters inside double-quoted `Write-Host` strings (`[`, `(`, em-dash) caused parse errors in Windows PowerShell 5.1
  - Replaced double-quoted strings with single-quoted strings plus explicit concatenation for variable interpolation. Applied to all 12 platform copies.

### Thanks

- @raykuo998 for both Windows compatibility fixes (PR #86, PR #88)

---

## [2.18.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Mastra Code hooks were silently doing nothing**
  - Root cause: Mastra Code reads hooks from `.mastracode/hooks.json`, not from SKILL.md frontmatter. The existing integration had hooks defined only in SKILL.md (Claude Code format), which Mastra Code ignores entirely. All three hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop) were non-functional.
  - Added `.mastracode/hooks.json` with proper Mastra Code format including `matcher`, `timeout`, and `description` fields
  - Fixed `MASTRACODE_SKILL_ROOT` env var in SKILL.md Stop hook (variable does not exist in Mastra Code, replaced with `$HOME` fallback to local path)
  - Bumped `.mastracode/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` metadata version from 2.16.1 to 2.18.1
  - Corrected `docs/mastra.md` to accurately describe hooks.json (removed false claim that Mastra Code uses the same hook system as Claude Code)
  - Fixed personal installation instructions to include hooks.json copy step

---

## [2.18.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Copilot hooks garbled characters — still broken after v2.16.1** (Issue #82, confirmed by @Hexiaopi)
  - Root cause: `Get-Content` in all PS1 scripts had no `-Encoding` parameter — PowerShell 5.x reads files using the system ANSI code page (Windows-1252) by default, corrupting any non-ASCII character in `task_plan.md` or `SKILL.md` before it reaches the output pipe. The v2.16.1 fix was correct but fixed only the output side, not the read side.
  - Secondary fix: `[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8` returns UTF-8 with BOM — replaced with `[System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)` (UTF-8 without BOM) in all four PS1 scripts to prevent JSON parsers from receiving a stray `0xEF 0xBB 0xBF` preamble
  - Fixed files: `pre-tool-use.ps1`, `session-start.ps1`, `agent-stop.ps1`, `post-tool-use.ps1`
  - Bash scripts were already correct from v2.16.1

### Thanks

- @Hexiaopi for confirming the issue persisted after v2.16.1 (Issue #82)

---

## [2.18.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **BoxLite sandbox runtime integration** (Issue #84 by @DorianZheng)
  - New `docs/boxlite.md` guide for running planning-with-files inside BoxLite micro-VM sandboxes via ClaudeBox
  - New `examples/boxlite/quickstart.py` — working Python example using ClaudeBox's Skill API to inject planning-with-files into a VM
  - New `examples/boxlite/README.md` — example context and requirements
  - README: new "Sandbox Runtimes" section (BoxLite is infrastructure, not an IDE — kept separate from the 16-platform IDE table)
  - README: BoxLite badge and Documentation table entry added
  - BoxLite loads via ClaudeBox (`pip install claudebox`) using its Python Skill object — no `.boxlite/` folder needed

### Thanks

- @DorianZheng for the BoxLite integration proposal (Issue #84)

---

## [2.17.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Mastra Code support** — new `.mastracode/skills/planning-with-files/` integration with native hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop), full scripts, templates, and installation guide (platform #16)

### Fixed

- **Skill metadata spec compliance** — applied PR #83 fixes across all 12 IDE-specific SKILL.md files:
  - `allowed-tools` YAML list → comma-separated string (Codex, Cursor, Kilocode, CodeBuddy, OpenCode)
  - `version` moved from top-level to `metadata.version` across all applicable files
  - Description updated with trigger terms ("plan out", "break down", "organize", "track progress") in all IDEs
  - Version bumped to 2.16.1 everywhere, including canonical `skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md`
  - OpenClaw inline JSON metadata expanded to proper block YAML

### Thanks

- @popey for the PR #83 spec fixes that identified the issues

---

## [2.16.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Copilot hooks garbled characters on Windows** (Issue #82, reported by @Hexiaopi)
  - PowerShell scripts now set `$OutputEncoding` and `[Console]::OutputEncoding` to UTF-8 before any output — fixes garbled diamond characters (◆) caused by PowerShell 5.x defaulting to UTF-16LE stdout
  - Bash scripts now use `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False)` — preserves UTF-8 characters (emojis, accented letters, CJK) in `task_plan.md` instead of converting them to raw `XXXX` escape sequences

### Thanks

- @Hexiaopi for reporting the garbled characters issue (Issue #82)

---

  - This fixes `/planning-with-files` slash command not appearing for users

### Changed

- SKILL.md frontmatter now follows [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
- Version now stored in `metadata.version` field
- Removed `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable references from SKILL.md (use relative paths)
- Updated plugin.json to v2.4.0

### Technical Details

The previous SKILL.md used non-standard frontmatter fields:
```yaml
# OLD (broken)
version: "2.3.0"           # NOT supported at top level
user-invocable: true       # NOT in official spec
hooks:                     # NOT supported in SKILL.md
  PreToolUse: ...
```

- All community members who tested and provided feedback

  - Root cause: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to repo root, but templates were only in subfolders
  - Added `templates/` and `scripts/` directories at repo root level
  - Now templates are accessible regardless of how `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` resolves
  - Works for both plugin installs and manual installs

### Structure

After this fix, templates exist in THREE locations for maximum compatibility:
