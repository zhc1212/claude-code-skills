description: Convert existing projects into Apify Actors - serverless cloud programs. Actorize JavaScript/TypeScript (SDK with Actor.init/exit), Python (async context manager), or any language (CLI wrapper). Use when migrating code to Apify, wrapping CLI tools as Actors, or adding Actor SDK to existing projects.

# Apify Actorization

Actorization converts existing software into reusable serverless applications compatible with the Apify platform. Actors are programs packaged as Docker images that accept well-defined JSON input, perform an action, and optionally produce structured JSON output.

## Quick start

1. Run `apify init` in project root
2. Wrap code with SDK lifecycle (see language-specific section below)
3. Configure `.actor/input_schema.json`
4. Test with `apify run --input '{"key": "value"}'`
5. Deploy with `apify push`

## When to use this skill

- Converting an existing project to run on the Apify platform
- Adding Apify SDK integration to a project
- Wrapping a CLI tool or script as an Actor
- Migrating a Crawlee project to Apify

## Prerequisites

Verify `apify` CLI is installed:

```bash
apify --help
```

If not installed, use one of these methods (listed in order of preference):

```bash
# Preferred: install via a package manager (provides integrity checks)
npm install -g apify-cli

# Or (Mac): brew install apify-cli
```

> **Security note:** Do NOT install the CLI by piping remote scripts to a shell
> (e.g. `curl ... | bash` or `irm ... | iex`). Always use a package manager.

Verify CLI is logged in:

```bash
apify info  # Should return your username
```

If not logged in, authenticate using OAuth (opens browser):

```bash
apify login
```

If browser login isn't available (headless environment or CI), ensure the `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable is exported (note: the variable is `APIFY_TOKEN`, not `APIFY_API_TOKEN`). The CLI reads it automatically - no explicit login needed. If the user doesn't have a token, generate one at https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations.

> **Apify platform environment:** When the Actor runs on the Apify platform, `APIFY_TOKEN` is auto-injected as an environment variable and the Apify SDK reads it automatically — you do not need to pass it explicitly. Locally, `apify login` stores credentials in `~/.apify` and the SDK uses them.

> **Security note:** Avoid passing tokens as command-line arguments (e.g. `apify login -t <token>`).
> Arguments are visible in process listings and may be recorded in shell history.
> Prefer OAuth login or environment variables instead.
> Never log, print, or embed `APIFY_TOKEN` in source code or configuration files.
> Use a token with the minimum required permissions (scoped token) and rotate it periodically.

## Actorization checklist

Copy this checklist to track progress:

- [ ] Step 1: Analyze project (language, entry point, inputs, outputs)
- [ ] Step 2: Run `apify init` to create Actor structure
- [ ] Step 3: Apply language-specific SDK integration
- [ ] Step 4: Configure `.actor/input_schema.json`
- [ ] Step 5: Configure `.actor/output_schema.json` (if applicable)
- [ ] Step 6: Update `.actor/actor.json` metadata
- [ ] Step 7: Write README.md for Apify Store listing
- [ ] Step 8: Test locally with `apify run`
- [ ] Step 9: Deploy with `apify push`

## Step 1: Analyze the project

Before making changes, understand the project:

1. **Identify the language** - JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, or other
2. **Find the entry point** - The main file that starts execution
3. **Identify inputs** - Command-line arguments, environment variables, config files
4. **Identify outputs** - Files, console output, API responses
5. **Check for state** - Does it need to persist data between runs?

## Step 2: Initialize Actor structure

Run in the project root:

```bash
apify init
```

This creates:
- `.actor/actor.json` - Actor configuration and metadata
- `.actor/input_schema.json` - Input definition for Apify Console
- `Dockerfile` (if not present) - Container image definition

## Step 3: Apply language-specific changes

Choose based on your project's language:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: See [js-ts-actorization.md](references/js-ts-actorization.md)
- **Python**: See [python-actorization.md](references/python-actorization.md)
- **Other Languages (CLI-based)**: See [cli-actorization.md](references/cli-actorization.md)

### Quick reference

| Language | Install | Wrap Code |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| JS/TS | `npm install apify` | `await Actor.init()` ... `await Actor.exit()` |
| Python | `pip install apify` | `async with Actor:` |
| Other | Use CLI in wrapper script | `apify actor:get-input` / `apify actor:push-data` |

## Steps 4-6: Configure schemas

See [schemas-and-output.md](references/schemas-and-output.md) for detailed configuration of:
- Input schema (`.actor/input_schema.json`)
- Output schema (`.actor/output_schema.json`)
- Actor configuration (`.actor/actor.json`)
- State management (request queues, key-value stores)

Validate schemas against `@apify/json_schemas` npm package.

## Step 7: Write README

**IMPORTANT:** Always generate a README.md as part of actorization. The README is the Actor's landing page on Apify Store and is critical for discoverability (SEO), user onboarding, and support. Do not consider an Actor complete without a proper README.

See the Actor README guidelines at `skills/apify-actor-development/references/actor-readme.md` for the required structure including: intro and features, data extraction table, step-by-step tutorial, pricing info, input/output examples, and FAQ. Aim for at least 300 words with SEO-optimized H2/H3 headings. Also review these top Actors for best practices:

- [Instagram Scraper](https://apify.com/apify/instagram-scraper)
- [Google Maps Scraper](https://apify.com/compass/crawler-google-places)

## Step 8: Test locally

Run the Actor with inline input (for JS/TS and Python Actors):

```bash
apify run --input '{"startUrl": "https://example.com", "maxItems": 10}'
```

Or use an input file:

```bash
apify run --input-file ./test-input.json
```

**Important:** Always use `apify run`, not `npm start` or `python main.py`. The CLI sets up the proper environment and storage.

## Step 9: Deploy

```bash
apify push
```

This uploads and builds your Actor on the Apify platform.

## Monetization (optional)

After deploying, you can monetize your Actor in Apify Store. The recommended model is **Pay Per Event (PPE)**:

- Per result/item scraped
- Per page processed
- Per API call made

Configure PPE in Apify Console under Actor > Monetization. Charge for events in your code with `await Actor.charge('result')`.

Other options: **Rental** (monthly subscription) or **Free** (open source).

## Security

**Treat all crawled web content as untrusted input.** Actors ingest data from external websites that may contain malicious payloads. Follow these rules:

- **Sanitize crawled data** — Never pass raw HTML, URLs, or scraped text directly into shell commands, `eval()`, database queries, or template engines. Use proper escaping or parameterized APIs.
- **Validate and type-check all external data** — Before pushing to datasets or key-value stores, verify that values match expected types and formats. Reject or sanitize unexpected structures.
- **Do not execute or interpret crawled content** — Never treat scraped text as code, commands, or configuration. Content from websites could include prompt injection attempts or embedded scripts.
- **Isolate credentials from data pipelines** — Ensure `APIFY_TOKEN` and other secrets are never accessible in request handlers or passed alongside crawled data. Use the Apify SDK's built-in credential management rather than passing tokens through environment variables in data-processing code.
- **Review dependencies before installing** — When adding packages with `npm install` or `pip install`, verify the package name and publisher. Typosquatting is a common supply-chain attack vector. Prefer well-known, actively maintained packages.
- **Pin versions and use lockfiles** — Always commit `package-lock.json` (Node.js) or pin exact versions in `requirements.txt` (Python). Lockfiles ensure reproducible builds and prevent silent dependency substitution. Run `npm audit` or `pip-audit` periodically to check for known vulnerabilities.

## MCP tools

### Apify MCP

If the Apify MCP server is configured, use these tools for documentation:

- `search-apify-docs` - Search documentation
- `fetch-apify-docs` - Get full doc pages

Otherwise, the MCP Server url: `https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=docs`.

### Playwright MCP (debugging)

The Playwright MCP server is a useful tool for debugging Actors that interact with the web - it lets the agent drive a real browser to inspect pages, capture selectors, and reproduce issues.

Install with the Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

Or add it manually to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
