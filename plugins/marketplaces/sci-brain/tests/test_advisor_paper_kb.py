"""Structural tests for advisor knowledge bases.

The advisor KB layout mirrors the project KB:
    advisors/<slug>/
      profile.md           # always present (committed)
      ref.bib              # advisor's BibTeX namespace (optional; created on first append)
      .knowledge/          # gitignored cache (optional; populated by researchstyle/download-ref)
        INDEX.md
        NOTES.md
        .raw/{arxiv,doi}/...
        .figures/...
        <id>_<slug>.md

We only enforce: each advisor has profile.md, and the .knowledge cache
is gitignored if/when it exists.
