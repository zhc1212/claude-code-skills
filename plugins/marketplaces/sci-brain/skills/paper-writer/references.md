## A. John Martinis — *Writing a Scientific Paper* (Oct. 2012)

UCSB experimental-physics group notes. Original PDF in `sources/NotesOnWritingPaper12.pdf`.

### General principles

- Break the paper into 7 sections (Title/Abstract, Intro, Theory, Methods, Results, Analysis, Conclusions). Short letters drop the explicit headers but the reader still parses these roles.
- Title + abstract is a short *advertisement* of the paper.
- A reader should get the basic idea from title + abstract + introduction + figures-and-captions + conclusions alone.
- Figures + captions must explain the work by themselves.
- Captions: concise, but define the data and summarize the graph.
- Introduce no more than one concept per sentence. If you break this rule, both concepts must be simple.
- Sequence figures, results, and explanations deliberately for clarity.
- Use references aggressively — they save you from re-deriving or re-justifying.

### §1 Title and Abstract

- Rewrite *last*, once you fully understand the experiment.
- One paragraph, 5–10 lines, roughly one sentence per body section.
- Title: descriptive.

### §2 Introduction — why should readers be interested?

- Start with the general principle being tested and why it matters to physics.
- Include history — what was done before, what you're testing newly.
- Include why it may matter for applications in science and technology.
- Start discussing the background physics of your system.
- This is the hardest section to write but the most important for acceptance.

### §3 Theory — background to understand the experiment

- State or review the minimum theory needed.
- It's fine to state assumptions and quote formulas without derivation, assuming an expert audience. Include intermediate steps only if non-trivial. Keep concise — this is an experiment, not a theory paper.
- The figure of the experiment usually goes here.
- Define terminology and variables logically (order matters: earlier symbols define later ones).
- Keep the physics basic; subtler details belong in the Analysis section.

### §4 Experimental Methods — so the experiment can be repeated

- Enough detail to reproduce, but not too much on trivial issues. (As a student, err toward "more"; the advisor will cut.)
- Be concise: state, don't explain.
- *Do* write fully about tricky, unusual, or surprising steps you needed.
- Order methods logically; build on what you've already discussed.
- Refer to the experimental sketch often; add figures/pictures if needed.
- Check every variable is defined.

### §5 Results — a sequence of graphs telling a story

- Plot *all* figures *before* writing — they are the backbone.
- Use a series of figures to tell a story, from simple data to complex analysis. Be logical in the order, building on concepts already explained.
- You don't have to show all raw data in the complex figures.
- Discuss check experiments. Use an appendix or a supplementary paper (Nature/Science/PRL space limits) if they fragment the flow.
- In the text, walk the reader through each plot: explain x-axis, then y-axis, then how data changes with x. Data is obvious to you, not them.
- After trends, discuss where errors come from and what error bars represent.
- Your data describes nature and is "correct" by itself. If it disagrees with theory, that's fine — but the more radical the result, the harder acceptance becomes.

### §6 Analysis — how the data makes theoretical sense

- Often intertwined with Results; combining them is fine, especially when a sequence of increasingly complex graphs carries the explanation.
- Convention: **data as points, theory as lines, plotted together** so the reader can immediately see agreement.
- Best when theory plots as a *straight* line — anyone can then check by eye. Curved-theory plots only with deliberate reason.
- Does theory pass through error bars?
  - Small deviations within bars: fine.
  - A few slightly outside: fine.
  - Many large deviations: discuss as possible systematic error.
  - Error bars much bigger than deviations: also discuss — you've likely underestimated errors.
- Introduce more complex theory or check theory *here*, not in §3.

### §7 Conclusions — what was learned

- Short paragraph summarizing the results.
- Optional second paragraph on applications, future directions, implications.
- Acknowledge significant help, then funding sources, in a final separate paragraph. (Funding acknowledgments are important — don't omit them.)

## B. Jan von Delft — *Style Guide* for scientific writing

LMU theoretical-physics group guide. Online: <https://homepages.physik.uni-muenchen.de/~vondelft/JansStyleGuide.html>

### Guiding principle

*"Only polished products sell well."* Readers expect optimized final work, not your development history. Poor presentation = audience disengages within minutes.

### Notation and equations

- **Consistency:** never reuse the same symbol for different meanings in nearby sections.
- If notation must change, *signal it explicitly* — never silent.
- Invest time early in choosing the most convenient notation. If a better choice appears mid-project, **adopt it henceforth and rewrite earlier work** rather than tolerating inconsistency.
- Reader annoyance with bad notation is a leading cause of paper abandonment.
- Compact formulas: use when explaining strategy, summarizing manipulations, when reader needs only conceptual structure, and when experts can fill in.
- Explicit (long) formulas: use for non-obvious steps, hard-won tricks, simplifications of prior expert work, key intermediates downstream work depends on, flagship results, and equations matched to plotted figures (reference the figure in the caption).
- Avoid explicit formulas that any competent reader could derive from compact ones — they waste reader attention.

### Figures — the most-remembered element

- "Figures are what most readers remember best about your paper, talk, or poster. Therefore, it pays to optimize them."
- **Design for multiple uses:** key figures must work unchanged in a talk. Build in beamer-compatibility at paper time, not later. Test on an actual projector. Test greyscale printing before submission.

#### Beamer compatibility

- **Line weight ≥ 2** for all curves (or at minimum for main results).
- **Color choice:** avoid faint colors (light yellow / green / grey). Prefer black, blue, red, dark orange, magenta, violet, dark brown.
- Distinguish curves with line *style* (solid, dashed, dash-dot) in addition to color so the figure survives greyscale.

#### Greyscale safety

- Include "(Color online)" in the caption when publishing in color.
- Refer to line *style*, not color, in captions: "the dashed line shows" not "the red line shows."
- Test actual greyscale output.

#### Legend / labeling

- Legend text and axis numbers should not be much smaller than surrounding paper body text. Maximum reduction factor 2/3.
- Place small parameter boxes (e.g., `T = 0`, `V = 0`) directly in the figure to save caption space and increase talk-suitability.

#### Dimensionless quantities (theory papers)

- Use dimensionless plots (`G/G₀`, `T/Γ`, `V_g/Γ`, ...) whenever possible:
  - generalizes the result beyond a single parameter set,
  - clarifies the relevant scale of the problem,
  - choose the dimensionless combination that *maximizes clarity of the main message*.
- If a better combination is found after plotting, redo the plot — the time is worth it.
- Exception: comparison with dimensional experimental data.

#### Critical rule

> **"NEVER, EVER, plot anything in arbitrary units!!!"** (Referenced negatively to Jan Hendrik Schön's problematic practice.)

#### Figure explanation

- Discuss and explain every important, novel, or striking feature in the text. The reader expects an explanation for unexpected peaks/dips — ideally a back-of-envelope argument.
- If you don't understand a featured element: either exclude it, or comment explicitly that it merits future investigation.

### Ten tips for *starting* paper writing

A sequence of tasks that defeats perfectionism-induced writer's block.

1. Start with **figures** — identify which figures best convey the main message. Plot them.
2. Make an **outline** — telegram-style organization plus key equations. Show to advisor; require feedback.
3. **Draft the introduction roughly.** Explain field interest, big questions, and (in accessible language) main results. For long papers, indicate where the key results / figures appear. Polish later; rough draft now to prevent paralysis.
4. **Write Section 2 carefully** — complete sentences (cannot postpone indefinitely). Writer's block usually dissolves here. Show this section to an advisor or collaborator early for style/notation/clarity feedback.
5. **Abstract and introduction refinement.** Only after the body nears final form. Polish them together.
6. **Conclusions** often restate the introduction in newly technical language — the reader now has the background.
7. **Clarify main results.** Walk the whole paper; ensure each main result has a sentence like *"This figure / equation / conclusion is our (first, second, third...) main result."*
8. **Iterate the main body extensively.** Many revision passes.
9. **Final polish on abstract / intro / conclusion.** Once more, after the body is done. "95% of all readers will read only these."
10. **External feedback.** Friends and officemates; experts in the area (most oblige if interesting; mention the submission timeline); competitors as goodwill. Take all comments seriously — unclear passages to a friend will confuse a referee.

### Theses (vs. papers — different audience)

- Papers target time-limited experts; theses target fellow grad students and professors outside your sub-field, learning from your work.
- Include more detail than papers, with pedagogical presentation: precisely what you did and how.
- Don't reproduce long textbook passages.
- Citations: precise — equation and page numbers, not "just citing a 700-page book by name."
- Summarize the key ideas behind standard methods even when not deriving them in full.
- When integrating already-published papers (which were optimized for expert readers): add introductory sections sketching background, plus technical appendices explaining details experts take for granted. Write to yourself ten years from now.

### Posters

- Function: blackboard-level prompts that *you* explain face-to-face. Not for solo reading.
- Without the speaker, viewers read only: title, sometimes abstract, "very important!" visual figures.
- Design principle: **BIG, SIMPLE, ONLY KEY WORDS, NO LONG PARAGRAPHS.**
- Include references; pin A4 copies of the poster nearby; offer preprints.

### Talks

- *Every talk is a potential job talk.* A single talk may decide a hire. Maximize quality every time.
- First-slide ideal contents (≈ 5 minutes of intro material — not the bare title-and-name slide that audiences see for 10 seconds):
  1. Title, speaker name (underlined), co-authors, collaborators.
  2. One or two beautiful motivating figures + one or two summarizing main-result figures.
  3. One-line statement of the main question.
  4. Outline of *at most* 4–5 points.
  5. One-line statement of the main result.
- Sequence: introduction first, *then* outline (so the outline lands when the audience is engaged).
- Per-slide rules:
  - One key idea per slide. The slide title names that idea.
  - One-line takeaway at the bottom, highlighted (red on yellow works).
  - Pace at 2–3 minutes minimum per slide (preferably 3–5). Rushing causes the audience to disengage.
- Figures and equations on slides:
  - Almost every slide has a figure. If you have no results figure, draw an explanatory cartoon.
  - Maximum three equations per slide.
  - Resist live derivation — "99% of the audience is lost within 10 seconds." Talks convey intuition and results, not derivations.
- References: included inconspicuously, complete (`First-author et al., PRL, 10, 193 (2000)`), and visible. People notice when they're miscited.
- Summary slide: mini-versions of main-result figures + open questions + future prospects.
- Avoid cute animations (swirling, blinking) — distracting.
- Consistent color scheme: color 1 for titles, 2 for references, 3 for formulas, 4 for main results, etc. Same fonts.
- Inexperienced speakers: type out a word-for-word script for the first few minutes (and for any delicate moments — competitor errors, inconclusive experiments). Memorize.
- Practice talks: at least one a week before. For job/invited talks, two or three.

### Structural principles (information flow)

- **Logical-linear flow.** Introduction → body → conclusions. First sections build context; later sections assume earlier material.
- **Topic-stress positioning.** Begin sections with motivation; end with main results.
- **Given-new.** Introduce notation and concepts before using them. Don't assume reader familiarity with your conventions.
- **Signposting.** Explicitly signal notation changes. State main results with "This is our main result." Use outline slides/sections.

### Sentence-level rules

- **Active over passive** where it sharpens the agent of the action.
- **Parallelism** — outline points, takeaways, lists should be grammatically parallel.
- **Avoid nominalization** — verbs over noun-phrase-of-verb. ("Adopt notation" beats "perform notation adoption.")
- **Concrete vivid verbs:** optimize, alert, adopt, iterate.

### Common mistakes (cross-reference)

- Notation: symbol reuse; tolerating bad notation; silent changes.
- Figures: thin lines; faint colors; tiny text; arbitrary units; unexplained features.
- Writing: perfectionism before drafting; polishing intro/abstract before body is drafted; no early-feedback loop; no explicit main-result statements.
- Talks: title-only first slide; outline before introduction; rushing; too many equations; inconsistent formatting; under-practice.
- Theses: copying expert paper text without pedagogical context; vague citations; failing to explain standard methods.

### Summary — core principles

1. Excellence requires sustained effort: *"only polished products sell well."*
2. Audience matters: papers serve time-limited experts; theses serve learning students; talks convey intuition and results.
3. Notation and presentation enable understanding: consistency and clarity precede correctness.
4. Visuals dominate memory: figures first, integrated everywhere.
5. Pacing permits comprehension: enough time per slide, section, equation.
6. State main results explicitly: at least one sentence per major result, clearly labeled.
7. External feedback is essential.
8. Practice and iterate: early feedback and many revision passes prevent late catastrophes.
