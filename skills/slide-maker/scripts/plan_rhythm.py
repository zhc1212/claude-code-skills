"""Compose the deck's ARCHITECTURE as a sequence, before any page is built.

The gap this closes is one this skill can state precisely about itself. `lint_deck` demands at
least four distinct page skeletons on an 8+-slide deck (SKELETON VARIETY) and reports three
adjacent slides sharing 75% of their structure (LAYOUT SAMENESS) — but both fire AFTER the build,
at which point varying the architecture means re-laying pages that are already written. So the
architecture gets decided one page at a time, in the order the content happened to arrive, and the
usual result is one skeleton repeated with different words in it. Measured on a deliberately dead
deck built for this check: zero layout findings, a clean lint, and three skeletons across fourteen
slides.

Deciding the sequence FIRST is what a designer does, and it is cheap to do deterministically —
this is arithmetic over the slide roles, not a model call. It runs in milliseconds, adds no
round-trip, and hands back a table the author builds from and the design checkpoint shows.

    python3 scripts/plan_rhythm.py --roles cover,context,method,result,result,compare,takeaway,close
    python3 scripts/plan_rhythm.py --slides 12 --carry 4,7          # roles unknown yet
    python3 scripts/plan_rhythm.py --gates <deck-dir>               # read roles from .deck-gates.json
    python3 scripts/plan_rhythm.py --selftest

🔴 A PROPOSAL, not a verdict. It knows the shape of an argument, not your argument — deviate wherever
the content wants something else, and say so in the design plan where deviations are recorded. What
it guarantees is only that the sequence it proposes clears the two structural floors, so the
architecture is a decision rather than an accident.
