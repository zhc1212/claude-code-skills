"""extract_pdf — pull a figure OUT of a source PDF (paper / report) as a clean PNG.

The skill's first rule of figures is *use the source's own figure, whole* (step 4) — but
a figure trapped in a PDF can't be placed until it's a PNG. This gets it out, three ways,
in order of how often you want them:

1. render_page  — rasterise a WHOLE page to high-DPI PNG. The most reliable: it captures
   the figure exactly as it appears (vector + text + raster composited), so a multi-panel
   figure, axis labels, and a colour bar all come through. Then crop/place it in the build.
2. crop_region  — rasterise just a rectangle of a page (a single figure on a busy page),
   so you don't carry the surrounding body text. Give the rectangle in page POINTS
   (72/inch, origin top-left) or as fractions of the page with frac=True.
3. extract_images — dump the page's EMBEDDED raster images at native resolution. Highest
   quality for a single photo/bitmap figure, but a vector chart or a multi-image panel can
   come out fragmented or empty — fall back to render_page/crop_region when it does.

Why rasterise rather than always extract: a paper figure is usually vector + text, not one
bitmap; rendering the page is what reproduces what the reader actually sees. Use a high DPI
(>=300) so the placed figure stays crisp when it fills a slide.

PREFERRED — auto-detect & crop figures straight from the paper (no manual coordinates,
no asking the user for originals). It anchors on captions ("Figure N" / "Fig. N" / "Table N"),
grows into the adjacent graphics bounded by body text + neighbouring captions, then snaps to
content. This is the *primary* path; the manual page/crop commands below are the fallback.
    python3 extract_pdf.py figures paper.pdf            # list every detected figure + checks
    python3 extract_pdf.py figures paper.pdf 4          # just page 4
    python3 extract_pdf.py figure  paper.pdf 2 fig.png  # render detected figure #2 (auto-trimmed)
    python3 extract_pdf.py autofig paper.pdf figs/      # render ALL detected figures to figs/
`figures` prints each box with cov= (graphics coverage), bodyov= (body-text overlap) and a
"⚠ CHECK" flag when a crop looks suspect (low coverage, body/foreign-caption bleed) — ALWAYS
view a rendered crop before using it, and for a flagged one fall back to the manual loop.

Quick start (manual fallback):
    python3 extract_pdf.py info paper.pdf                      # page count + sizes
    python3 extract_pdf.py page paper.pdf 4 fig.png --dpi 300  # page 4 (1-based) -> PNG
    python3 extract_pdf.py crop paper.pdf 4 fig.png 60 90 540 360
    python3 extract_pdf.py crop paper.pdf 4 fig.png 0.1 0.12 0.95 0.55 --frac
    python3 extract_pdf.py images paper.pdf 4 figdir/          # embedded images -> figdir/

LONG-SOURCE MODE (a book / very long PDF — map before you read, then read the parts that matter):
    python3 extract_pdf.py map      book.pdf                   # structural skeleton: TOC + word-density
    python3 extract_pdf.py headings book.pdf 1 400            # reconstruct a skeleton for a NO-TOC book
    python3 extract_pdf.py text     book.pdf 40 72 ch3.txt    # dump pages 40-72 for a chunked read
`map` dumps NO body text (triage only: page + CJK-aware load/token estimate + the author's own
TOC/bookmarks + a binned density strip, and a ⚠ if the doc is scanned/non-PDF); `headings` emits
candidate heading lines by font-size outlier when there's no embedded TOC; `text` dumps a 1-indexed
inclusive page range, keeping PAGE markers so every claim traces back to a real page. Works on any
fitz-openable doc (PDF/EPUB/…); convert .docx/.md/web to PDF first. See the content-planner's
long-source method.

To find a manual crop box: render the page once, open the PNG, read off the figure's pixel
box with `crop_helper.py grid`, divide by the render scale (dpi/72) to get points — or use
--frac and eyeball fractions. Importable: from extract_pdf import find_figures, render_figure.

# Caption labels. Two things the plain `fig(?:ure)?\s*N\b` form got wrong on real papers:
#
# 1. SMALL CAPS MAPPED INTO THE PRIVATE USE AREA. Journals that set "FIG." in small caps often
#    ship a font whose glyphs carry no Unicode mapping, so the text layer reads
#    'F\uf769\uf767. 1. Illustration of...' -- an F followed by two PUA codepoints. `fig` cannot
#    match that, and on one AAPM paper it took out ALL FOURTEEN captions: every figure came back
#    labelled '(figure)', so nothing downstream knew which figure it was or what it showed. The
#    leading real letter survives, so [FTSA] + a run of PUA recovers the label (and its kind);
#    a wholly-PUA label falls back to the kindless form.
#
# 2. IN-TEXT REFERENCES matched as captions. A paragraph opening "Fig. 7 shows an example of..."
#    or "Table 1 compares MoViD against baselines..." was taken as that figure's caption -- worse
#    than a miss, because a body sentence then gets attached and reported as the caption. A real
#    caption puts a DELIMITER after the number ("Fig. 1." / "Fig. 1:" / "Figure 1 |") or, in
#    IEEE style, an all-caps title ("TABLE I QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON..."); an in-text reference
#    continues with a lowercase verb. Hence the lookahead. `(?-i:[A-Z])` is scoped deliberately:
#    under re.I a plain [A-Z] matches lowercase and re-admits every reference.
#

# recovered, -11 in-text references rejected, 0 real captions lost.
