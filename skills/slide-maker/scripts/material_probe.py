"""The Step-2 MATERIAL PROBE contract, in one place, imported by every gate path.

Step 2 opens by BUILDING one real slide — the page the signature move lands on, in the register you
just invented — rendering it, and LOOKING at it, before the design plan's twenty declarations are
written. The record is the rendered PNG plus one sentence: *what would the SAFE version of this page
have been?*

🔴 **WHY THIS IS A SHARED MODULE AND NOT A CONSTANT IN EACH GATE.** `anchor_proof.py` exists because
`render_deck.py --gate-check` and `codex_delivery_gate.py` diverged on the anchor proof's file key —
one spelled it `path`, the other `png` — so a bridged run wrote what its own gate demanded and the
other rejected it. The material probe was heading the same way: the carve list had just been written
into two gates by hand, and adding the Codex arm would have made three copies of a four-word tuple.

What lives here is the CONTRACT — which carves exist, and what a waiver must carry. What stays local
to each gate is the STRICTNESS of the artifact check: the shared path opens the PNG and rejects a
flat one, while the Codex path binds it to a SHA-256 and to the final PPTX hash. Folding those
together would have to weaken one to the weaker of the two.

🔴 `conservative` IS NOT A CARVE, deliberately. Step 2 says so in as many words: restraint is a
material decision too, and a page is exactly where you see whether it reads as deliberate or as
nothing. (The ANCHOR PROOF at Step 4 *does* carve for it — that one proves a risk survived the
build, and a deck that took no risk has nothing to prove. Two different questions, two different
carves; conflating them is why this note is here.)
