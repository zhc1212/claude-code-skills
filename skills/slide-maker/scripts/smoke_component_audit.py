"""Regression for component_audit — both directions, because the false-positive side is the one
that would damage design capability if it regressed.

The tool must (a) catch a genuinely hand-rolled common form, and (b) stay silent when the same
geometry was drawn BY a component the deck actually called — a component's own output must never
be reported as a hand-roll, or the audit trains an agent to stop using components.
