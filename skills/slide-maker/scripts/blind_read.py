"""The BLIND READ-BACK contract — the gate that reads the PICTURE instead of the file.

🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. Every other check in this skill answers "what does the file contain". Seventy-odd
scripts read XML, geometry and pixel contrast; none of them reads the page as a page. The failure
that survives all of them is the one where the file is well-formed and the rendered slide does not
show what the record claims. From this repo's own record, every one of these shipped GREEN:

    a wireframe deck (one skeleton, zero components, three type sizes)   — caught by a human
    `<placeholder>` text that cleared every width floor                  — caught by adversarial review
    LibreOffice drawing negative bars as absolute values                 — caught by a human
    a deck of six grey blocks                                            — caught by "设计能力变弱了"
    an all-motif deck that shipped zero icons                            — caught by the user, first line
    Chinese text measured 46% short by every geometry gate               — caught by a human

`render_selfcheck` is the one mechanism aimed at this, and it is the ONLY gate artifact whose
CONTENT nothing verifies — its own docstring says so: "it proves the trace exists, not that the eye
judged well (a lazy `ok` on a bad slide still passes)". Measured: a 15-slide deck recorded `ok` on
all fifteen, and the user's first sentence named a defect on it.

WHAT THIS DOES DIFFERENTLY — three properties, each aimed at a way self-checking fails:

  1. BLIND. The reader is handed slide PNGs and a fixed question list, and is NOT handed the
     content record. It cannot restate a takeaway it never saw, so agreement means the picture
     carried the idea rather than the reader carrying it.
  2. COMPARATIVE. The gate computes DISAGREEMENTS between what was seen and what was recorded. It
     produces findings, not a score — there is nothing to write `ok` into.
  3. ANSWERED, NOT ASSERTED. Every finding needs a written resolution (fixed, or dismissed with a
     reason). A count cannot be acted on and a verdict cannot be forged into agreement.

🔴 THE HONEST LIMIT, stated the way `render_selfcheck` states its own. This proves that an
independent reader answered fixed questions about the pixels and that the disagreements were
computed mechanically rather than asserted. It does NOT prove the reader was truly blind if the
operator chose to leak the record into the packet, and it cannot see a defect the question list
never asks about. It is a floor under the critic, not a replacement for it.

    every finding it computes to be present with the SAME severity. Faking now means faking the

    every slide — which is the same bar as faking the critic, and nothing like deleting a line.
