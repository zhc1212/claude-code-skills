"""assemble — robustly combine independently-authored SECTIONS into one deck.

The naive way to parallelize a big deck is to build N separate .pptx files and merge
them. Don't: python-pptx has no clean slide-copy API, so merging means deep-copying
XML, relationships, and embedded images across packages — fragile and bug-prone.

This is the robust alternative. Each section is a *module* exposing `build_section(prs)`
that APPENDS its slides to a shared Presentation. We build ONE base deck and run every
section into it, in order. Result: a single file, no XML merge, and — because every
section imports the SAME `style` module (palette, font, chrome, layout constants) —
zero cross-section drift. That's what protects coherence while sections are authored
in parallel by different subagents.

Workflow this supports (see references/large-deck-orchestration.md):
  style.py              # single source of truth (palette/FONT/helpers) — one owner
  section_01_intro.py   # def build_section(prs): ...   (imports style)
  section_02_method.py  # def build_section(prs): ...   (imports style)
  ...
  -> orchestrator runs build_deck(out, [section_01..., section_02...], template=...)
  -> then the critic panel reviews the ASSEMBLED deck.

Each section subagent can self-check while authoring by rendering JUST its section
(`preview_section`), then returns its finalized module for assembly.

CONTRACT (don't break it): all sections AND the single `style.py` live in ONE directory,
and every section does `import style`. Python caches the first `import style` in
sys.modules, so giving sections *separate* style.py files in different dirs would silently
make them all use the first one — exactly the drift this tool prevents. One shared
style.py is the design; keep it that way.

    The sys.modules cache is what guarantees coherence WITHIN a deck — every section gets the
    identical palette object, so they cannot drift. It is also, ACROSS decks, contamination:
    build two decks in one interpreter and the second silently inherits the first's style,
    because `import style` finds the cached module and never looks at disk again.

    Measured: two directories with `PALETTE = "DECK-A-MAGENTA"` and `PALETTE = "DECK-B-TEAL"`,
    `build_deck` called twice in one process, printed
        deckA section sees PALETTE = DECK-A-MAGENTA
        deckB section sees PALETTE = DECK-A-MAGENTA
    and no gate could see it, because the second deck is internally CONSISTENT — every slide is
    wrong together, which is the one shape a coherence check is blind to. A coordinator assembling
    two decks in one session (a redesign plus its before/after, a deck and its appendix) got the
    first deck's colours in the second and nothing said so.

    Evicting the cached `style` before each deck keeps the within-deck guarantee (all of ONE
    deck's sections still import the same module object) and drops the across-deck leak.
