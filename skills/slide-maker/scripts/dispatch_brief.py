"""Write the deck's dispatch brief ONCE, then point every subagent at it.

Why this exists
---------------
Measured on a real 14-slide build: nine subagent dispatches cost **41,203 output tokens —
~12.5 minutes**, the most expensive turn class in the whole pipeline, at ~4,600 tokens per
dispatch. Almost none of that was per-dispatch information. Every prompt re-stated the same
interview answers, the same absolute paths, the same search cap, the same auto-waiver state and
the same CONTRACT CARD; what genuinely differed was a lens letter, a section range, or a round
number — a few dozen tokens.

Prose cannot fix this. "Don't repeat yourself in dispatch prompts" is exactly the class of
instruction this skill keeps proving gets skipped, because nothing reports it: the dispatch
works, the subagent does its job, and the bill arrives as wall clock nobody attributes. So the
repetition is removed structurally — the shared part becomes a FILE the subagent reads, and the
dispatch prompt becomes a pointer.

There is a fidelity dividend, and it may matter more than the minutes. `references/critic-panel.md`
requires the CONTRACT CARD to be assembled from the approved plans "declarations only, never
rationale" at EVERY critic dispatch, and warns that reconstructing it from memory is how a
declared contract quietly stops matching what was approved. A file written once and read by all
is the same card every time, by construction.

What it does NOT do
-------------------
It does not invent content. The brief is written by the coordinator, from the approved plans;
this tool creates the skeleton, refuses to hand out a prompt while required sections are still
unfilled, and prints the pointer. A brief that lies is still a brief that lies — being in a file
does not make it true.

The brief is written to a SCRATCH path, never into the deliverable folder
(`references/checkpoint-convention.md`: plan files never ship beside the deck).

Usage
-----
  python3 scripts/dispatch_brief.py init  --deck <deck-dir>          # create + print the path
  python3 scripts/dispatch_brief.py check --brief <path>             # gate: all sections filled?
  python3 scripts/dispatch_brief.py prompt --brief <path> \\
          --role critic --lens A --round 2                           # print the dispatch prompt
  python3 scripts/dispatch_brief.py prompt --brief <path> \\
          --role section --section 2 --slides 6-10
