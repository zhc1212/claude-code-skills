"""Resolve a deck's palette into FILL-only vs TEXT-safe tokens — once, before the build.

WHY THIS EXISTS. SKILL.md already states the rule: "a hue used as TEXT must itself clear >=4.5:1
on its background", so keep two tokens per accent — a bright fill and a darker text-safe twin.
The rule is correct and it is still easy to break, because the check is per-PAIR and a build
touches dozens of pairs. Measured on one real deck, the author declared the two-token rule in
the design plan and then violated it four separate times — a vivid ochre set as a tier label on
its own pale slab (2.34:1), coral emphasis text on a coral tint (4.19:1), a table's highlight
colour (4.19:1), and a muted grey used for real content on cream (4.26:1). None were reckless;
each was a pair the author simply was not thinking about while computing contrast ad-hoc for a
different pair. Every one surfaced at render time or in review, each costing a round.

A matrix is the fix. Computing all N x M pairs once costs nothing and turns "I remembered to
darken the coral" into a table you read. Print it at Step 2/3, paste the FILL/TEXT split into
the design plan, and build from the tokens it hands back.

    # explicit tokens

Thresholds are WCAG: 4.5 body text · 3.0 large text (>=18pt, or >=14pt bold) · 3.0 non-text
marks (icon glyph on its tile, a symbol on a chip, an arrowhead on a band — WCAG 1.4.11).

Exit 0 when every pair the deck actually needs is resolvable, 1 when a token has no safe use.

# ── COLOUR VISION: the palette that separates for you and collapses for 1 reader in 12 ────────
# `deckkit.OKABE_ITO` has been offered as "the colour-blind-safe categorical fallback" since it was
# added, and `references/data-viz.md` recommends it — but nothing ever CHECKED a palette, so the
# recommendation only helped the author who already remembered it. Contrast and CVD are different
# questions and a palette can pass one while failing the other: two hues at very different
# lightness always clear a contrast ratio and can still be the same colour to a deuteranope.
#
# Roughly 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some colour vision deficiency, so on a room of forty
# this is not an edge case — it is most rooms. The simulation is Brettel/Viénot-style: convert to
# linear RGB, project onto the dichromat's plane, convert back.
# The simulation is Viénot–Brettel–Mollon (1999): sRGB -> linear -> LMS cone response -> project
# onto the plane the missing cone leaves -> back. Doing it in LMS is not pedantry. The first
# version of this used the widely-copied 3x3 "RGB-space" matrices instead, and it was WRONG in a
# way that passes a casual look: greys and white came back unchanged, so it seemed fine, while pure
# green under deuteranopia came out PINK-GREY (#A59595) when a deuteranope in fact sees it as
# yellow. A wrong simulation is worse than none — it would have cleared palettes that collapse and
# flagged palettes that do not.
