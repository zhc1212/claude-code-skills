"""One call for the edit → build → check loop, so an iteration costs one round-trip.

WHY. Measured on a delivered 12-page build: 133 tool calls, of which the
edit/build/render/lint loop was 67 — about 21 of the 88 minutes the whole deck took. Almost none
of that was computation. The deterministic pipeline for that same deck is 9.1 seconds end to end
(build 1.8 · render 5.4 · lint 1.9); everything else was the cost of asking for one step at a
time. This does not make the steps faster. It makes one iteration one question.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO — three guards, because a shortcut through a checking pipeline
is exactly how a pipeline stops checking:

  1. **Findings are printed VERBATIM, never counted.** A report that says "2 findings" instead of
     the two messages has moved the cost from round-trips to information, which is a worse trade:
     the messages name the slide, the shape and the remedy, and acting on a number is impossible.
     There is no --quiet, and there is no summary mode.

  2. **Rendering is OPT-IN (`--render`).** Most iterations are "fix a geometry fault and re-check",
     which needs the build-time lint and nothing else — 1.8s. Forcing a render into every cycle
     would add 5.4s to the majority of iterations and make the loop SLOWER while looking faster.

  3. **A CRITICAL build fault stops the cycle before rendering.** The build script's own
     `lint_layout(strict=True)` raises, and that stop is load-bearing, not an inconvenience: a
     deck with a critical geometry fault should not be rasterised, looked at, or reasoned about
     as if it were finished. This tool propagates the stop; it never renders past one.

  4. **The LOOP BREAKER: the third consecutive failure of the same fault is never answered with
     another nudge.** The one genuinely uncapped loop in the pipeline is edit → build → lint on
     a single stubborn slide: measured on a real deck, 10+ iterations of adjusting a constant by
     a few points each time — and the fix that finally landed (computing the layout from the
     measured content) landed on its FIRST try. So this tool keeps a per-fault streak across
     consecutive runs in `.deck-cycle-state.json` beside the build script (same slide + same lint
     code = same fault; the message's numbers may change, the key does not). When a fault
     survives 3 consecutive runs it escalates: stop nudging, RE-DERIVE that slide's layout by
     measurement — `fit_text`/ink measurement, or a form helper that owns the geometry
     (`sigs.py --example <form>`). A fault that clears resets its streak; a fresh build script
     resets them all.

     🔴 **And the escalation BINDS: the next run is refused if the edit was another nudge.** A
     rule whose only enforcement is the author choosing to obey it fails silently, and a silent
     failure here means the loop carries on exactly as before. So "another nudge" is defined by
     the FILE, not by intent: `_nudge_fingerprint` hashes the build script's AST with every
     numeric literal normalized to 0, so an edit that moved only numbers leaves the fingerprint
     UNCHANGED — and an unchanged fingerprint after an escalation is refused before the build is
     even spent. Restructure (a helper call, computed geometry, fewer words) and it runs. If a
     constant really is the fix, `--nudge-again "<why>"` runs it and records the reason beside the
     deck; a gate with no way through stops being a gate and becomes something to work around.
     It never changes THIS run's exit code and never suppresses a finding — it changes the next.

It is an ALTERNATIVE entry point, not a replacement. `render_deck.py` and `lint_deck.py` keep
their own behaviour and every existing invocation still works — nothing in the pipeline is routed
through here, and a step this skips is a step you can still run yourself.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/deck_cycle.py build_<deck>.py                 # build + build-time lint
    python3 scripts/deck_cycle.py build_<deck>.py --render        # …+ render + render-time lint
    python3 scripts/deck_cycle.py build_<deck>.py --render --fast # …re-rendering changed pages only
    python3 scripts/deck_cycle.py build_<deck>.py --slides 3,7    # render only these pages
    python3 scripts/deck_cycle.py build_<deck>.py --nudge-again "<why>"   # after an escalation

Exit code uses lint_deck.py's vocabulary, so a caller can tell the two apart:
    2 = a stage could not run   ·   1 = everything ran and the deck has findings   ·   0 = clean
