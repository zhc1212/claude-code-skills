"""Every canvas format's contract, checked against the BUILT deck instead of trusted.

`formats.py` is a registry of design surfaces: margins, platform-UI safe zones, whether columns
work, whether the surface carries deck chrome, how dense it may be. Measured by grep, NOTHING
consumed it downstream — `import formats` appears in exactly two files, both of which are
producers. A build script opts into the registry voluntarily, and no check afterwards can tell
whether it did. So every per-surface rule in `references/canvas-formats.md` was advisory by
construction, on the surfaces where getting it wrong is least recoverable: a story caption placed
under the swipe bar is invisible to the person who built it on a desktop, and a poster is wrong
only once it has been printed at a metre wide.

What this checks, per format, recovering the format from the canvas SIZE (a built PPTX carries
nothing else):

  TYPE FLOOR       a PRINTED surface is read at a fixed distance, so its point sizes are absolute,
                   not a share of the canvas. lint's canvas-relative floor is right for a projected
                   deck and meaningless for a poster — on a 33in-wide A0 it would demand ~45pt body,
                   while deckkit's own cover cap of 46pt prints a title that cannot be read across a
                   hall. This applies the three-distance floors the format declares.
  MISSING SECTION  a surface may declare content it is not finished without. A poster declares
                   methods and limitations: the billboard style that reads best is also the style
                   that tends to drop exactly the two things a passer-by cannot reconstruct.
  SAFE ZONE        text inside the platform UI zones a vertical/social format reserves.
  COLUMNS          side-by-side splits on a canvas whose registry entry says `columns_ok=False`.
  DECK CHROME      a footer strip on a `social` surface, which carries no deck furniture.

    python3 scripts/check_surface.py <deck.pptx> [--format NAME] [--waive-sections "<reason>"]
    python3 scripts/check_surface.py --selftest

Deliberately NOT here: margins and full-bleed. `lint_deck.py` already owns off-canvas and bleed,
including the `design_intent(envelope="bleed")` / `bleed_intent()` declarations a hero legitimately
makes — a second opinion about the same pixels would disagree with the first on every cover.

🔴 It checks the format CONTRACT, not the design. A poster can pass every line here and still be
an unreadable wall — density, hierarchy and figure quality belong to the lint, the sameness gate
and the critic. Exit 0 clean · 1 findings · 2 could not run.
