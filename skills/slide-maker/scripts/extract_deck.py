"""Pull the CONTENT out of an existing .pptx so a redesign can reuse it.

When the user hands you their own deck to *improve*, you need its real material —
the actual text per slide, the tables, the charts' numbers, the embedded figures, and
what they planned to SAY — not a guess at what's on it. This dumps all of it so the
rebuild is faithful to what they wrote and reuses their figures whole (see
design-principles: "use the source's own figures").

Pairs with render_deck.sh (which shows you what each slide LOOKS like) — run both:
render to see the design problems, extract to recover the content to carry forward.

**This tool is also the reconcile path.** `handoff-and-iteration.md` names it as the
preferred way to recover a user's hand-edits before a post-delivery rebuild, and that
procedure ends by declaring the build script canonical again. So anything this drops is
not merely missing from a report — it is deleted from the user's deck on the next
rebuild, by the procedure that exists to protect it. Two things it used to drop:

  * SPEAKER NOTES. There was no `notes_slide` reference in the file at all, so the
    user's entire narration — the thing a presented deck is actually *for* — was
    discarded by the tool whose stated job is to be faithful to what they wrote.
  * NATIVE CHARTS. A chart is a GraphicFrame: it matches neither PICTURE nor
    `has_table` nor `has_text_frame`, and the walk had no `else`, so its categories and
    series vanished without a word. Worse, a slide that was nothing BUT a chart came out
    as the literal string `_(empty / decorative only)_` — the tool did not just lose the
    data, it affirmatively reported that there had been none.

The rule that follows, and the one worth keeping: **never report absence you have not
verified.** A shape this script cannot read is now listed as UNEXTRACTED with its type,
so a lossy extraction announces itself instead of looking complete.

Usage:  python3 extract_deck.py /path/to/their_deck.pptx [out_dir]
Output: <out_dir>/content.md         — per-slide text, tables, chart data, notes, figures
        <out_dir>/assets/slideNN_*   — every embedded picture, saved whole
(default out_dir: ./extracted)
