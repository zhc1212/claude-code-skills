"""A deck's PURPOSE declares content it is not finished without — checked against the built file.

`references/design-by-purpose.md` carries nine purpose recipes, and measured by grep NOTHING
consumed it: every per-purpose rule in that file was advisory by construction, so a build could
ignore it line by line and no gate would know. Four genres with the most rigid conventions were
missing from the list entirely — grant proposal, progress/guidance committee, journal club,
clinical case presentation — and three of those are among the most common decks an academic makes.

This is the same mechanism `check_surface.py` applies to SURFACES, generalised to genres, and for
the same measured reason: the shape of a genre is exactly what an author under time pressure drops.
A poster drops methods and limitations; a grant deck drops feasibility and risk; a committee deck
drops the ask and becomes a status update.

    MISSING SECTION   the purpose declares a section and nothing in the deck names it
    FIDELITY NOTE     the one fidelity rule this genre carries beyond never-invent (always printed,
                      never a finding — it is a rule for prose, which no scan can judge)

🔴 WHAT IT IS AND IS NOT. It asks whether the deck NAMES the thing, not whether it does it well. A
grant deck can name its risks in two words and pass; judging whether the mitigation is credible is
the critic's job and always will be. The cheap catch is the one worth having — a grant deck with no
feasibility section and a committee deck with no ask are not weak decks, they are decks missing a
section their audience is required to score.

🔴 NO BINDING, NO CLAIM. A deck whose recorded purpose matches no registry entry reports NOT
CHECKED and exits 2. Guessing a genre would be worse than checking nothing: applying a clinical
case's section list to a product pitch would fire four times and teach the author to ignore it.
