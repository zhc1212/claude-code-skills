"""The AUDIENCE BRIEF contract, in one place, imported by every gate path.

Step 1 writes a comprehension brief about the SOURCE. On a deck with no source there is nothing to
comprehend, so that brief becomes a summary of the SUBJECT — and a subject brief produces a deck
*about* the topic where one *for* the audience was asked for.

🔴 THE MEASURED DEFECT. A deck was built from the interview answers `audience = people planning a
trip` and `goal = they leave able to plan one`. The comprehension brief described Melbourne. Three
arc candidates were then generated inside that frame, and the winner was picked because "it is the
only candidate whose organising idea also does the organising work … nothing is easier to remember
a week later" — a DECK-QUALITY test. The recorded `goal` was never used to score them. The runner-up
was rejected for becoming "the same list every travel site gives me", which for someone planning a
trip is the deliverable, not the failure mode. What shipped was a thesis on an 1837 land survey.

The damage starts UPSTREAM of the arc and reaches the research: that build verified chain lengths,
allotment widths and inscription years, and gathered nothing on daily cost, distances, a rainy-day
alternative or what to skip. Information gathering is aimed by the frame, so a wrong frame aims it
wrongly and every later gate passes.

🔴 THE SAME RULE ALREADY EXISTED AND DID NOT FIRE. `checkpoint-convention.md` carries the Paris
measurement — a run that refused the Eiffel-tower silhouette as a motif and then deleted the
landmarks from the CONTENT — but it is scoped to the auto-waiver's *delegated Step-0 picks*. The
Melbourne build ran a full interview, so it was never inside that rule's scope. A correct rule in
the wrong scope is not a gate.

WHAT THIS FIELD IS. Not a persona and not a summary: the DECISIONS the audience has to make, in
the order they will face them, each with what they need in hand to make it. Write it BEFORE
gathering information, and aim the gathering at it.
