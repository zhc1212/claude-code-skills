"""Every keyword parameter a helper ACCEPTS must be READ somewhere in its body.

The defect class this closes is silent by construction. A component takes a parameter, documents
it, and never reads it — so the caller writes the call the docs describe, no exception is raised,
no lint fires, and the deck ships with the setting ignored. Three shipped instances, each found by
hand and each in a different file:

  * ``deckkit.gantt(accents=[...])``  — ignored for plain 3-tuple tasks, so every bar drew in
    deckkit's default blue. That silently violates SKILL.md's 🔴 "never ship deckkit's default
    blue", with no backstop anywhere in the tree.
  * ``anim.slide_transition(kind="push")`` — ``kind`` appeared exactly once in the file, in the
    signature; the body hardcoded ``<p:fade/>``. Every non-fade transition was a fade.
  * ``deckkit.native_bubble(xlabel=, ylabel=, point_labels=)`` — all three discarded, one of them
    documented in the docstring.

Whether a parameter is read is decidable by a program, so it belongs here rather than in prose.
The rule is deliberately weak — *mentioned anywhere in the body* — because the strong version
("actually affects the output") is undecidable and the weak one already catches every instance
above. False positives get a written waiver, never a loosened rule.
