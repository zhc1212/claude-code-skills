"""Write and shape-check `.deck-gates.json` — the record every hand-off gate reads.

Every other expensive artifact in this pipeline has an emitter: the critic brief has
`dispatch_brief.py init`, the review contract has `validate_review.py --schema`, the consent
record has `--record`. The design plan block did not, so it was hand-typed JSON whose field
SHAPES were discoverable only by failing the gate — and the gate stops at the first problem in a
section, by a deliberate and tested contract ("its later checks read values the earlier one
validated"). Measured on one real build: **six consecutive `--gate-check` runs**, each naming
exactly one field — `boldness` in the wrong dial format, then `signature_proof`, then
`material_probe`, then `concept` in the wrong shape, then `type_scale.body` under the floor, then
`form_reach`. Six full context re-sends to learn six facts that were knowable up front.

This does not change the gate. It puts the shapes where they can be read BEFORE the run:

    python3 scripts/deck_gates.py init  <deck-dir> [--slides N] [--delivery presented]
    python3 scripts/deck_gates.py check <deck-dir>          # ALL shape problems at once
    python3 scripts/deck_gates.py set   <deck-dir> design_plan.boldness bold
    python3 scripts/deck_gates.py set   <deck-dir> design_plan.carried_by '[4, 6, 13]'
    python3 scripts/deck_gates.py --selftest

🔴 It writes the SHARED record, `.deck-gates.json` — the one `render_deck.py --gate-check` and
`lint_deck.py` read on every runtime. The Codex delivery path ALSO keeps `.codex-deck-evidence.json`,
a different schema owned by `codex_delivery_gate.py`; this tool neither writes nor validates that
one, and running it does not excuse producing it (`references/codex-runtime.md` step 3a).

🔴 `check` is a SHAPE pre-flight, not the gate. It never opens the .pptx, so it cannot know
whether the anchor PNGs render, whether the register was applied, whether the credits reached a
slide, or whether the deck is too same. `render_deck.py --gate-check` remains the authority and
must still be run — this only stops you from spending round-trips on typos and wrong shapes.
