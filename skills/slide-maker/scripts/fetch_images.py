"""Search and download LICENSE-CLEAR photographs, and keep a provenance ledger of what happened.

`references/image-generation.md` owns the REFERENT RULE: a real-and-specific subject (a named
place, a real product, a real person) gets a REAL sourced photo, and generating one that CLAIMS
photographic reality of it is a fidelity bug. That whole pipeline — search Commons/Openverse,
verify the subject, record the license, treat to the palette, write an evidence token — existed
only as prose, executed by hand, every run. Two consequences, both silent:

  * the API calls were re-derived per deck (query shape, license filtering, which field carries
    the attribution string), which is the same "arithmetic nobody should re-derive per deck"
    argument `deckkit.register_mark` was written from; and
  * the `searched (Commons, Openverse), none found -> generated, flagged illustrative` rung was
    UNFALSIFIABLE. Nothing recorded that a search ran, what it asked for, or what came back — so
    "I looked and there was nothing" and "I did not look" produced identical decks, and the
    cheaper one is the one a tired run picks.

This script makes the search a recorded event. Every query lands in `sources.json` next to the
assets with its result count and outcome, every adopted file lands with its license, author,
attribution string and sha256 — so `check_image_provenance.py` can hold the plan's evidence
tokens against something real instead of against a claim.

**It never decides that a photo is GOOD.** Subject-correctness and the aesthetic bar
(construction cranes, ugly snapshots, watermarks) are eyes-and-judgment gates that stay with the
model — `image_qc.py` measures what a program can measure and prints a contact sheet precisely so
that looking is cheap. A file this script downloads is a CANDIDATE, not an approved plate.

**Network failure is NOT "none found".** A blocked host, a proxy, an offline box: every one of
them makes the sources return nothing, and treating that as "no photo exists" launders a
connectivity problem into a licence to generate fake photography. Unreachable sources exit 2 with
a distinct message and never write a `none found` outcome.
