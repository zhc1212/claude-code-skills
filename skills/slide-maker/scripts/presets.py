"""presets — named DESIGN-LANGUAGE presets: one switch sets a coherent palette + fonts + surface
treatment + image-prompt style, so a deck's look is consistent from the first slide.

These are *starting languages*, not straitjackets — the model still tunes to the brand/purpose and
the user's references always win. Apply one like:

    from presets import preset
    # NOTE: CJK faces use 'Hiragino Sans GB' — it is in /System/Library/Fonts on every Mac,
    # while PingFang is a downloadable asset a given Mac may not have (see deckkit.EAFONT).
    p = preset("glassmorphism")
    deckkit.FONT = p["font"]; deckkit.DISPLAY = p["display"]; deckkit.MONO = p["mono"]
    INK = p["ink"]; ACCENTS = p["accents"]; BG = p["bg"]
    # For a CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) deck, ALSO set the East-Asian slot, or the Latin face
    # (e.g. "Arial Black") tofus on CJK glyphs:
    deckkit.EAFONT = p["ea"]; deckkit.EADISPLAY = p["ea_display"]
    # build glass cards on a BG-filled slide lit by deckkit.glow(...), per p["surface"]

Each preset carries Latin faces (`font`/`display`/`mono`) AND a CJK fallback pair (`ea`/`ea_display`,
sensible defaults to adjust per script — the JP/KR equivalents are in references/multilingual.md).
`image_prompt` is the prefix to feed the generated-template image route (references/
generated-template.md) so generated plates match the chosen language. Pair with the Style library
in references/generated-template.md and the per-purpose guidance in references/design-by-purpose.md.

`guard` = the preset's 1-3 REGISTER-DEFINING constraints (countable/absolute, negatives first).
Unlike the rest of the preset, guards survive the "vary it" rule: the designer/builder honor them
literally and the critic flags any violation as a register break. They define the register; they
are not a straitjacket on palette tuning.

PRECEDENCE: a guard is a register floor for the SKILL'S OWN choices only. An explicit user request
or a recorded named deviation (the plan line naming the guard it overrides) lifts it, and the
critic treats a recorded guard deviation like the stylized-illustration deviation — a taste call,
not a register break.

# ── FORBIDS — the machine-checkable half of each `guard` ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# `guard` is prose written for the author, and prose is satisfiable by intending to satisfy it.
# Measured: the same content under 18 different `presets.apply()` calls produced 18 pages that
# differed only in ground colour, corner radius and rule weight — memphis without its coloured
# header bands, bauhaus without a primitive, glassmorphism without a glass card. Declaring a
# register and shipping its palette is the "只是一些颜色的搭配就说使用了这个模板" failure, and
# nothing measured it: `check_register_pixels.py` says in its own docstring that it judges COLOUR
# IDENTITY only.
#
# So each preset names the SHAPE-LEVEL prohibitions a machine can settle. Deliberately narrow: a
# check that fires on lawful composition teaches the reflex to waive it, so this covers only
# properties that are read straight off the OOXML and need no judgement of taste.
#
#   rounded             a shape whose prstGeom is a rounded family (roundRect, round2SameRect…)
#   gradient            a gradFill anywhere on the shape
#   soft-shadow         shadow.inherit left True — the theme's soft shadow, never switched off
#   proportional-face   any run in a face outside the mono whitelist
#   confetti            more than ONE oversized primitive (>=6% of the canvas)
#
# What is NOT here is as deliberate: "photography carries all the colour", "no diagrams straight
# on the navy", "titles must be full-sentence conclusions" are all real rules in `guard` and none
# of them is decidable from the file without judging meaning. They stay prose, and the checker
# reports which registers it could not check rather than implying silence is a pass.

    near-black page. Deriving it from the register's own two colours keeps it in the register by
    construction, which hand-picking eighteen values would not — and it stays correct if a
    preset's bg or ink is ever retuned.

    The step is small on purpose (12% toward the ink): a panel has to separate from the ground
    without competing with the content on it. Verified across all 18 registers to sit clear of the
    ground and still carry the register's ink above the 4.5:1 body floor.

    Before the structural tokens existed a preset was 5 colours, 5 font names and 3 English
    sentences — and the sentences ("NO rounded corners", "hairline rules", "THICK black
    rules/borders") were the part that made a register look like itself, and the part nothing
    implemented. Honouring them meant abandoning the component library and hand-rolling with
    box(), because 55 components pass round=True with no caller-side switch. Now they are data:

        import presets, deckkit as dk
        p = presets.apply("brutalist")      # palette + fonts + hard edges + thick rules

    Returns the preset so the caller can still read `surface` / `guard` / `image_prompt`, which
    stay prose on purpose — they are art direction, not geometry.

    It also sets the GROUND. It did not, and that was the third half-application in a row: the
    preset carried `bg`, `apply()` returned it, and NOTHING painted it. 8 of the 18 registers are
    dark, so a caller doing exactly what this docstring said got the register's light ink on a
    white canvas — measured on `dark_tech`, body text at 1.18:1, surfaced only by the render lint,
    one build->render->diagnose round trip after the fact was already known. `set_ground` exists
    because `apply()` runs before any slide does, so it cannot call `slide_background()` itself.
