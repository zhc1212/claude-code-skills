"""anim — purposeful PowerPoint animations for decks built with deckkit.

python-pptx has no animation API, so this injects the slide's <p:timing> XML
directly. The model is deliberately simple and matches how a good presenter thinks:
draw your STATIC base first (titles, the always-visible scaffold), then wrap each
thing you want to *reveal on click* in a build step. Each step appears on its own
click, in order, with a tasteful fade by default.

Why click-builds (and not flying text): the point of animation in a talk is to
control attention and pace — reveal one idea at a time so the audience reads the
slide with you, not ahead of you. Motion that doesn't do that is noise. See
references/animation.md for when builds help and when to leave a slide static.

Usage (with deckkit; deckkit's helpers append shapes to the slide, so we capture
them by recording what gets added inside each step):

    from anim import Build
    b = Build(slide)
    # ... draw static base normally (always visible) ...
    with b.step():            # click 1 reveals everything drawn in this block
        chip(s, ...); arrow(s, ...)
    with b.step():            # click 2
        callout(s, ...)
    b.apply(effect="fade")    # default fade; also "appear", "wipe"

Verification caveat: render_deck.sh (LibreOffice) shows the FINAL built state only —
it cannot play the build sequence, and neither can the static-PNG critic. So (1)
make sure the fully-built slide reads correctly on its own (the PNG must be complete),
and (2) tell the user / note the intended click order. Confirm playback in real
PowerPoint / Keynote, which read this timing XML.
