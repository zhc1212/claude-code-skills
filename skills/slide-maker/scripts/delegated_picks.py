"""What the skill decided ON THE USER'S BEHALF — recorded, sourced, and floored.

🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. `references/checkpoint-convention.md` already states the rule precisely, with
its own measured failure: under "decide everything yourself" you ANSWER the Step-0 questions with
"defensible, purpose-derived picks" and post them as the FIRST FYI, "so a wrong pick costs one
glance to veto, not a build" — and **delegation covers preferences, never information only the user
has, and never which deck this is.** Measured: a run read a Chinese "you decide the rest" directive as licence to pick the ANGLE
too and delivered a thesis about 19th-century building regulation; every gate passed and it answered
a question nobody asked.

Nothing checked any of it. The FYI is prose in a chat; the record keeps `checkpoint.mode: auto` and
the picked VALUES, and from there a language the user stated and a language the skill invented are
byte-identical. So every downstream gate treats an INVENTED audience exactly like a given one, and
the hand-off has no way to say "these are the five things I decided for you".

WHAT THIS ADDS, and why it is a judgement lever rather than another field:

  basis        what IN THE REQUEST OR THE MATERIAL supports this pick. Not "I judged it" — being
               made to point at something turns a default into a reading of the actual input.
  alternative  on the three picks that decide everything downstream (audience · purpose ·
               template), what ELSE was plausible and why it lost. Every mechanism in this skill
               that demonstrably improves a decision works this way — the direction gate, the arc
               competition, the composition competition. A choice made against a named runner-up
               is a better choice than one made alone, and here it costs one sentence.

🔴 THE FLOOR, as a check rather than a paragraph. `angle` — which deck this actually is — may never
be `delegated`. A common genre carries a default the request already implies (「介绍巴黎的 PPT」 means
the city introduction people actually give), so it may be `genre-default`; it may be `stated`; it
may not be invented.

SCOPE. This binds only where the risk is: a deck whose checkpoints were delivered as `auto`. A deck
that ran a real interview records `stated` picks or nothing at all and is untouched.
