"""check_version — tell the user a newer slide-maker exists. Never do anything else.

Prints ONE line when the installed skill is behind, and NOTHING when it is current.
It never pulls, never checks out, never writes into the skill, and never fails a build: every
error path exits 0 silently, because a version notice that can break someone's deck is worse
than no version notice at all.

WHAT IT *DOES* TOUCH — stated because "never writes" was too broad and a security review read
it as "no side effects at all". On a git checkout it runs `git fetch origin main -q`, which
makes a NETWORK request and updates remote-tracking refs inside `.git` (never the working tree,
never a branch you are on). On a copy install it makes ONE HTTPS request to GitHub for the
VERSION file. Both are rate-limited to once per CACHE_HOURS and both are disabled by
`SLIDE_MAKER_NO_VERSION_CHECK=1`. The git subcommands used are exactly: fetch, remote, rev-list,
rev-parse, status — no pull, merge, checkout, reset or clean anywhere in this file.

TWO INSTALL SHAPES, and they need different questions asked
-----------------------------------------------------------
  git checkout / symlink   a .git exists above the skill  -> ask git how many commits behind
  npx skills add (a COPY)  no .git, no CHANGELOG           -> ask GitHub for the VERSION file

The second shape is why `skills/slide-maker/VERSION` exists. CHANGELOG.md lives at the
REPO ROOT, which `npx skills add` does not copy — so a copy install used to have literally
nothing on disk saying which version it was. The marker has to live inside the installed
directory or this check cannot exist for the majority of users.

COST
----
One network call at most once per CACHE_HOURS. Every other invocation reads a small JSON
cache and returns in ~5ms. That is what makes it safe to call on every run.
