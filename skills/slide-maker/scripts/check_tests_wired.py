"""Every test file must be RUN by CI — a test nobody runs is not a test.

🔴 THE MEASURED DEFECT. `tests/` held 68 files and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` named 49 of them.
**Sixteen test files had never run in CI**, including two written in the same change as the feature
they protect (`test_audience_brief.py`, `test_shape_declarations.py`) and one that was ALREADY RED:
`test_review_integrity.py` had four failing assertions and nothing anywhere reported it.

This is the same shape as the local-runner defect that preceded it — a harness that reports on a
subset looks exactly like a harness that reports on everything, because a skipped check and a
passing check both produce no output. Adding the sixteen files fixes today; this fixes tomorrow,
because the seventeenth is written by someone who does not know the rule.

A test may be deliberately excluded — it needs a network, it is a slow soak, it is a helper module
imported by another suite — but that is a DECISION someone makes in writing, not a file quietly
sitting outside the run.

    python3 scripts/check_tests_wired.py            # from the skill directory
    python3 scripts/check_tests_wired.py --list     # what CI currently runs

Exit 0 clean · 1 unwired tests · 2 could not run.
