"""Keep a bespoke register after the deck ships — the skill's design memory.

WHY. `references/bespoke-registers.md` holds FOUR invented registers. This user's own look history
holds at least NINE that were designed, shipped, and then lost: 改札 Signage · 验讫台 Inspection
Bench · Grootboek 分类账 · 配置行 Config-Row · Build Record · Section Drawing… Measured by grep,
no script anywhere writes a register or a look-history line: the mechanism was "remember to edit
the markdown by hand", which is not a mechanism. So the skill invents good registers and forgets
every one of them, and every deck starts its design from zero no matter how good the tooling gets.

The register is not re-described here — that is the other reason this never happened. Everything
needed is already in `.deck-gates.json`, written at the design checkpoint and verified at hand-off:
the pick, the palette, the motif's three generated things, the signature move. This reads that
record, adds what only the RENDER knows (the colours that actually reached the pixels), and appends
one entry.

It writes to the USER'S registry root, beside `taste.md` — never into the skill's own
`bespoke-registers.md`, which is a teaching library of worked examples, not a place for one user's
collection. `registry.py` resolves the root on any runtime, so a non-Claude host gets its own.

    python3 scripts/save_register.py <deck-dir>            # append (idempotent by name)
    python3 scripts/save_register.py <deck-dir> --dry-run   # print the entry, write nothing
    python3 scripts/save_register.py --list                 # what is already kept
    python3 scripts/save_register.py --selftest

Exit 0 written / already there / nothing to keep · 2 could not run.
