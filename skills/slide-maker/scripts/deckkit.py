"""deckkit — reusable helpers for building clean slides with python-pptx.

General-purpose: works whether you build ON a user's template (open_template) or
from scratch when they have none (blank_deck + title_bar/footer). Import this from
a small per-deck build script rather than copy-pasting primitives every time.
A brand-free worked example lives at references/examples/build_example_generic.py.

Design intent (see references/design-principles.md — these are the PRESENTED-deck defaults; a
read-alone / reference / poster deck legitimately runs denser, so flex by delivery mode):
  - terse, few-word points for a SPOKEN deck (a visual aid, not a document); a read-alone deck
    carries the fuller sentence a speaker would otherwise say
  - native diagrams (boxes + arrows) over walls of text
  - a clear title per slide; results figures always get a legend + a takeaway

The palette/fonts below are sensible DEFAULTS. When building on a template, pull
the real brand colors from it (inspect_template.py / theme) and set FONT to match;
when building from scratch, pick colors from the user's brand or pick a clean set.

Equations: NEVER rely on Unicode modifier-letter super/subscripts (ᴴ ᵀ ᵣ) — many
display fonts lack those glyphs and render tofu/overlap. Use eq_par(), which draws
real baseline-shifted ASCII in a full-coverage font, so it is crisp anywhere.

# ── runtime-dependency backstop ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Ensure the REQUIRED pip deps the moment deckkit is imported — the universal chokepoint EVERY deck
# build passes through, by ANY code agent, on any host. Step 0's `check_env.py --ensure` is a PROSE
# instruction an agent can skip; when it is skipped a missing dep otherwise surfaces here as a bare
# `ModuleNotFoundError` with no pointer to the fix. This makes the auto-install agent-independent.
# It fires ONLY when a dep is actually missing (`find_spec` is a cheap LOCATE, never a slow import),
# so it costs nothing on a warm machine; it installs into THIS interpreter with a `--user` fallback
# for externally-managed (PEP 668) envs, and never `--break-system-packages` (the user's call). Opt
# out with SLIDE_MAKER_NO_ENV_CHECK=1. Keep the list in lockstep with check_env.REQUIRED_PIP.
# (import-name, pip-name) — kept in lockstep with check_env.REQUIRED_PIP; test_env_bootstrap.py
# asserts the two are identical so they can never drift.

    at the moment you read it. `lint_layout` runs at the END of a build script, so by then the runs
    are already made. Two causes, and they want different follow-ups:

      · the runs went through `set_font()` but `EAFONT` was never set. Setting it at the top of the

      · the runs never went through `set_font()` at all — a REDESIGN / surgical fix-pass editing a
        deck this skill did not author, or raw `python-pptx` in the build script. `EAFONT` will not
        help next time either, because nothing reads it on that path; keep calling this.

    (`open_template()` is NOT a source: it drops every slide, and python-pptx clones layout
    placeholders empty, so no template-owned run ever lands on a slide. What a template really
    contributes is LAYOUT chrome — see `layouts=` below.)

    quietly doing nothing — a silent no-op here would leave the deck broken while making the lint
    line disappear, which is worse than the fault. `references/multilingual.md` has the per-OS
    pairing table (macOS "Hiragino Sans GB" · Windows "Microsoft YaHei" · Linux "Noto Sans CJK SC").

    Reaches every `<a:r>` and `<a:fld>` under each slide's shape tree — so GROUPS, TABLE CELLS and
    date/footer FIELDS are covered, none of which `CJK_NO_EA` can see (it walks `slide.shapes` and
    tests `has_text_frame`, and that is False for a group, a table and a graphic frame) — plus each
    CHART's `c:txPr/a:defRPr`, which lives in another part entirely and is where a chart's category
    and axis text gets its font. Fixing more than the gate reports is deliberate; those runs render
    with an uncontrolled fallback just the same.

    `layouts=True` extends the same pass to slide LAYOUTS and MASTERS. It is off by default because
    rewriting a supplied template's masters is a bigger act than clearing a lint line — but the

    or the shape's list style (`_inherited_ea`, the same question the CRITICAL asks). On a supplied
    CJK template the face usually lives one level up, and overwriting it at run level would
    retypeset someone else's deck as a side effect of clearing a lint line. An `<a:ea typeface=""/>`

    🔴 THIS EXISTS BECAUSE `box(round=True)` CANNOT DRAW ONE, AT ANY RADIUS. Measured, on a real
    deck whose signature motif was a two-state ring: `box(round=True)` renders a rounded
    rectangle, `r=d/2` renders a rounded rectangle, and the deck shipped three rendered
    iterations with a green SQUARE where its device was supposed to be — with no error, no lint
    finding, and nothing in the library to reach for instead. deckkit uses `MSO_SHAPE.OVAL`
    seventeen times internally (icon tiles, badges, `concentric_rings`, node discs) and exposed
    it nowhere, so every author who wanted a circle found the rounded-rectangle switch and
    believed it.

    Geometry follows `box`: `(x, y)` is the TOP-LEFT of the bounding square, not the centre, so a
    disc drops into a `columns()`/`rows()` rect the same way every other primitive does. Pass
    `h=` for an ellipse.

        dk.disc(s, x, y, 1.4, fill=PANEL, line=HAIR)         # a filled disc with an edge

    Like `box` it is `_flat()`ed, so it carries no inherited theme shadow — the second half of
    the same trap: a shape added with `slide.shapes.add_shape` outside deckkit keeps the theme
    `<p:style>` and LibreOffice draws a soft drop shadow under it (`INHERITED_EFFECT`), whose
    only cure was the private `_flat`.

    Returns the shape, so `tag_motif` / `alt_text` / `bleed_intent` compose with it.

    `axis_scale()` above is its sibling and answers a different question. That one maps a value to
    a POSITION on a track (dot strips, dumbbells, value-spaced timelines), where any `lo` is
    legitimate: a dot at 47 sits between 40 and 50 and reads correctly. This one maps a value to a
    LENGTH, where a non-zero baseline is not a scaling choice but a false statement — two bars of
    1.5 and 2.1 drawn from a baseline of 1.4 look like 1 : 7. There is no `lo` parameter here, and
    that absence is the point.

    Two things it removes from the caller, both of which have gone wrong in real builds:
      · the hand-rolled `w = v * SCALE`, where SCALE is derived once and then quietly reused for a
        second group of bars that is not on the same scale;
      · the sign. `max(abs(v))` reads naturally and picks the largest POSITIVE value when the
        negatives are smaller, which sizes the chart wrongly and puts the zero line in the wrong
        place. Here the extent covers `[min(0, min(values)), max(0, max(values))]`, so zero is
        always on the axis and negatives always draw on the far side of it.

    `sc.zero` is the distance from the span's start to the zero line; `sc.length(v)` is the bare
    magnitude in inches. `bar()` takes the span's START (not the zero line) as `x`/`y` and draws
    horizontally by default, `vertical=True` for columns growing upward from the baseline.

    Every bar it draws carries `DATUM_TAG`, so `lint_layout` can confirm that the drawn geometry
    is still proportional to the numbers — which catches a truncated baseline, a second scale
    leaking into one group, and a magnitude drawn where a signed value belongs. A bar you draw
    without this helper is simply unchecked; tag it with `mark_datum()` to opt it in.

    """A photo FULL-BLEED with the content on a near-opaque panel over the image's CALMEST region.

    THE FORM. A sourced photograph carrying a page, with the words on a solid block rather than
    floating on the picture. It is one of the three placements `image-generation.md` names for a
    content image (full-bleed background · side panel · inline figure), it was the only one with no
    component, and every part of it existed while the composition did not: `picture(fit="cover")`,
    `slide_background`, `scrim_overlay`, `photo_card`, `bottom_callout`. Hand-rolled, the same three
    things go wrong each time — the panel lands where the picture is busiest, the ink is chosen by
    eye against a photograph rather than against the panel, and the panel is made translucent enough
    to look elegant and too translucent to read.

    WHERE THE PANEL GOES IS MEASURED, not picked. `image_fx.quiet_region()` scores the image by
    local luminance variance and returns its calmest rectangle; the panel is snapped to the clean
    architectural shape nearest that region — a left band, a right band, or a lower band — so the
    words sit over the least informative part of the photograph and the subject stays visible.
    `panel="left"|"right"|"bottom"` overrides it, `panel="none"` returns the full safe rect for a
    page whose text sits directly on the picture (then YOU own the contrast).

    🔴 THE ALPHA FLOOR IS THE RULE, NOT A DEFAULT. SKILL.md's render self-check says a scrim only
    DIMS a bright line — it does not remove it — so text over image linework needs a near-opaque
    panel (alpha >= 0.88). Passing less raises here rather than shipping a page whose title has a
    balustrade running through it; for a deliberate gradient wash, `scrim_overlay` is the component
    that means that, and it says so in its own name.

    Returns `(x, y, w, h, ink)` — the content rect INSIDE the panel, and the ink colour resolved
    against the panel's own fill (`on()`), never against the photograph.

    `alt` is required: a photograph is informative content, and a missing alt-text is a BLOCKING
    accessibility finding at hand-off, so the component will not let a deck acquire one.
    `credit="Photographer / CC BY-SA"` places the attribution line an attribution-required licence
    needs ON THE SLIDE, which is what `check_image_provenance` looks for.

    🔴 WHEN NOT TO USE THE PANEL AT ALL. This puts an opaque block over the calmest part of the
    picture — which is right when the photograph is busy everywhere and the words have nowhere to
    stand, and wrong when that calm part is the best thing in the frame. A wide clean sky covered
    by a panel throws the sky away and keeps the clutter. There, `panel="none"` is the stronger
    page: it returns the safe rect and an ink chosen from the image's own measured luminance, and
    the words sit ON the photograph. Look at the render and decide; the measurement can tell you
    WHERE the picture is calmest and cannot tell you whether it is calm enough to write on.

    on a real build, that hand-rolled helper was eight lines long, offset each ring in x but not in
    y, and therefore drew THREE INTERLOCKING CIRCLES — a Venn diagram — in the corner of twelve
    pages. Nothing caught it: no lint knows what a motif is supposed to look like, and a human only
    saw it because they opened a PNG. The failure was not carelessness; it was that "draw three
    concentric arcs" is arithmetic nobody should be re-deriving per deck.

    `kind`:
      ``arcs``    concentric rings sharing ONE centre (`rings` of them). The centre is computed,
                  never offset per ring — the bug above is unrepresentable here.
      ``rule``    a thin edge rule inset from the page edge — the quietest possible signature.
      ``ticks``   `count` evenly-spaced short ticks along the edge (a scale, a gallery, a ruler).
      ``ordinal`` a small numeral/character set in the corner (a section index, a page cue).
      ``grid``    a small square field of hairlines (graph/plate register).

    `corner` is one of tl / tr / bl / br, or a literal (x, y) in inches for full control.
    `loud=True` marks this a HERO appearance and puts it in the <=3 budget; the default is the

    ship one was `lint_layout(strict=False)`, which switches the check off for the whole deck.

    device is, not in a note nobody reads.

    kinds (each is a GENERATIVE relation, not an ornament — pick the one whose relation is your
    content's relation, then swap the material):
      ``aperture``  frames narrowing to an opening — focus, filtering, a funnel
      ``conduit``   a spine crossing the page with tap-offs — accumulation along a line
      ``lattice``   interwoven members — coupling, network, mutual dependence
      ``orbit``     concentric paths with a rider — cycles, iteration, return
      ``radial``    rays from one origin — dispersion, reach, broadcast, divergence
      ``seam``      two registers meeting at a hinge — a crossing from one state to another
      ``strata``    stacked layers of unequal weight — depth, hierarchy, sedimented history
      ``terrace``   ascending steps — progression, escalation, staged advance

    `faint=True` drops the device to a ground the page's own content can sit on; the default is a
    hero strength, because this page is the one where the idea is allowed to be the subject.
    `at` positions the seam/spine (0-1 of the canvas), `orient` is 'v' or 'h' where that means
    something, `count` is how many members (taps, rays, layers, steps).

    colours each region by ``data`` on a light→``accent`` ramp, and draws a NATIVE title + gradient
    legend (so titles/units render in any language, CJK included, unlike text baked into the raster).

    ``data`` = ``{region: value}``. Keys: ISO-3166 alpha-2/alpha-3 or the English name for

    NO DATA, not zero — check the printed notice and fix any typo/ISO before shipping).

    **Shade a RATE / share / per-capita / index — not a raw COUNT** (a total just re-draws population/

    explicit symmetric ``vmin``/``vmax``; ``accent2`` sets the opposite pole). ``vmin``/``vmax`` fix the

              construction rather than only at render (`references/icons.md` "contrast").

    `size` is the tile edge in inches; the icon is inset by `pad` (default ≈26% so the glyph sits
    at ~50-55% of the tile — the tidy proportion). For a ROW of icons keep size/shape/treatment

    Keep it SMALL so it stays well under `gif()`'s `max_mb` and doesn't bloat the .pptx: a few-second

    outer margins and equal gutters between columns — or, with ``weights=``, a **measured
    asymmetric split** with the same symmetric margins.

    Use this for any split slide — text+figure, two-up, three-up, image+caption — so the
    left and right regions (and the white margins flanking them) come out the SAME width.
    The most common lopsided-slide tell is a left panel and right panel of different
    widths, or a wider white margin on one side than the other; that happens when x/w are
    eyeballed per panel. Deriving every panel from one grid makes the layout balanced by
    construction:

        L, R = dk.columns(2, slide=s)         # two equal halves, equal flanking margins
        dk.bullet(s, *L[:3], items)           # text in the left half
        dk.picture(s, fig, *R, fit="contain") # figure in the right half (same width)

    **Pass ``slide=`` so the grid matches the deck's REAL size** — the width/height are then
    read from the presentation, so it stays symmetric on a 16:9, a widescreen 13.333×7.5, or
    a poster. Only the no-arg call falls back to the standard 10×5.625 deck; if you call it
    without ``slide=`` on a differently-sized deck, pass the same ``w_in``/``h_in`` you gave
    ``blank_deck`` (otherwise the right margin will be wrong — the very lopsidedness this
    helper exists to prevent).

    ``weights=`` (keyword-only, one positive number per column, ``len == n``) divides the
    usable span **proportionally** instead of equally — the constructive form of two rules
    that otherwise live only as prose: *"an intentional asymmetric split still keeps equal
    outer margins"* and the fix for *"don't strand a narrow element in a too-wide panel"*
    (give the narrow timeline/list a genuinely narrower column). Reach for it as a
    **remedy** when the plan states a split/rail ratio, not as decoration::

        rail, main = dk.columns(2, slide=s, weights=(1, 2))     # a 1/3–2/3 split (rail + main)
        L, R      = dk.columns(2, slide=s, weights=(1, 1.618))  # a golden split

    Margin/gap/slide-size logic is untouched, so equal outer margins are inherited by
    construction; a mis-sized ``weights`` tuple raises ``ValueError`` (like ``n < 1``).
    Default ``weights=None`` keeps today's equal split exactly.

    ``margin`` (outer left == outer right) and ``gap`` (between columns) default to
    ``GUTTER``. ``top``/``bottom`` reserve room for the title bar and footer. Returns a
    list of ``(x, y, w, h)`` tuples in inches, left to right.

    downstream could even ask where the rail ended. `takeaway_rail` now sizes its body from this
    and returns its bottom y.

    🔴 The factor is ``_LINT_LINE_H * 1.2``, not ``1.2``. Those are two multipliers, not one: the
    ink model uses ``_LINT_LINE_H`` (=1.2) as the base line height and the rail's `text()` call
    multiplies it again by ``line_spacing=1.2``. Passing only the spacing under-measured the body
    by exactly 1.20x — the first version of this helper returned 4.57in for a rail whose ink
    really ended at 5.45in, i.e. it "fixed" the constant and kept the bug. Measured, per line at
    14pt: spacing 1.0 -> 1.2000 x pt/72, 1.08 -> 1.2960, 1.2 -> 1.4400, 1.4 -> 1.6800.

    bottom is never under the real ink bottom, which is the whole contract.

    🔴 `label` and `hero` are MEASURED, not assumed to be one line. An earlier version folded them
    into a 1.30in constant, which `check_param_reach.py` caught as "accepted and never read" —
    correctly, because it was a bug and not a no-op: a 34pt hero wrapping to 4 lines overflowed
    its 0.9in box by 1.394in and its ink ran to y=4.03, straight through a body that starts at
    y+1.30. For a one-line label and hero the arithmetic below is 0.30 + 0.04 + 0.90 + 0.06 =

    🔴 ``font`` is the face the text will actually be PLACED in — pass it whenever that is not

    this is the PREFERRED way to put equations on a slide. The ASCII eq_par() below is
    only a quick fallback; baseline-shifted ASCII never looks as good as real typeset
    math, so reach for equation_png whenever the audience will read the formula.

    Pass mathtext strings, e.g. r"\\hat{x} = \\mathrm{arg\\,min}_{x}\\,\\|Ax-y\\|_2^2 +
    \\lambda R(x)". Returns (w_px, h_px); place with add_picture, then scale to a target
    HEIGHT in inches (height = target_h; width = target_h * w_px/h_px) so glyph size is
    consistent across slides. Lazy-imports matplotlib.

    `mathfont` picks the math typeface (matplotlib mathtext.fontset):
      'cm'        — Computer Modern, the classic LaTeX look (default; formal & elegant)
      'stixsans' / 'dejavusans' — upright SANS math, to sit better next to a sans deck
      'stix'      — Times-like serif math
    Pick 'cm' for a formal/classical feel (academic, defense, any serif deck); a sans set to match a crisp corporate deck.
    `color` is an RRGGBB hex string (a leading '#' is tolerated; e.g. '202A37' for dark
    text on a light deck, 'FFFFFF' for light text on a dark panel).

    mathtext quirks (it is NOT full LaTeX — some control words differ, and older matplotlib
    is stricter, so prefer the safe forms below and you won't hit version differences):
      • use \\leq \\geq \\neq \\times (NOT \\le \\ge \\ne — these reliably raise ParseException);
      • write upright text as \\mathrm{...} (don't rely on \\text{}); use \\, \\; \\ for
        spacing inside it (e.g. \\mathrm{arg\\,min});
      • \\| gives the norm bars; \\hat \\mathcal \\Psi \\lambda \\epsilon \\Delta all work;

    'column_stacked_100' (share of 100%) | 'bar_stacked' | 'bar_stacked_100' | 'area' | 'area_stacked' |
    'area_stacked_100'. On a stacked kind each series gets its OWN palette colour — omit `highlight`
    (which greys the rest) so the mix reads; use '…_100' when the SHARE matters more than the total

    **`zero_base=True` (default) forces a ZERO value-axis baseline for column/bar charts** so bar
    LENGTH encodes the value itself, not ``value − auto_min``. Without it PowerPoint auto-crops the

    is only 1.09× larger — the classic 'cropped-axis drama' that MISREPRESENTS magnitude. It fires
    only for column/bar with all-non-negative data; line/line_markers keep auto-scale (a trend line
    legitimately wants a cropped axis). Pass ``zero_base=False`` only for a *deliberate* zoomed
    magnitude axis, and say why.

    **`emphasize=<category index>`** foregrounds ONE bar in a SINGLE-series column/bar chart (that
    bar keeps the accent, the rest drop to grey) — the per-category form of the single-highlight
    rule, since `highlight` selects a whole SERIES and so can't pick one bar on a one-series chart."""

    read cell by cell. `numeric_cols` = column indices to right-align (numbers read better
    right-aligned). `col_w` = column widths in inches (defaults to an equal split of `w`).

    Styled with NO PowerPoint theme — no banded blue, no gridlines: just a top rule, a rule
    under the header, and a bottom rule, so it reads like a paper table. Returns the bottom
    y so the caller keeps a GUTTER below it.

    NOTE: on a *presented* slide keep cells terse and highlight one row — it's a slide, not a
    spreadsheet. A **read-alone reference / appendix** table can legitimately be denser (more rows,
    smaller `row_h`, per-column rules) since the reader studies it without a narrator. A cell long
    enough to wrap past `row_h` will grow the row, so verify the render. For a *trend*, prefer a chart
    (`equation_png`/matplotlib or a dedicated figure-making workflow, if available);
    a table is for exact values."""

    🔴 It is placed as the FIRST child of `<p:cSld>` because CT_CommonSlideData orders `bg?`
    before `spTree` — appending would produce a schema-invalid part, the one defect class where
    PowerPoint refuses to open the file (`OOXML_SHAPE` is the net under that).

    moving the backdrop out of the shape tree would have made the colour behind ordinary text
    unknowable — silently switching off every contrast check on the deck (62 call sites resolve a

    The results slide of an image-reconstruction talk: reference · zero-filled · baseline · ours,
    over two or three cases, each cell carrying its own metric. `images[row][col]` are paths;
    `col_labels` is POSITIONAL because an unlabelled comparison grid says nothing about what is
    being compared (the same reason `unit_grid` demands its unit label).

    Two things it guarantees that a hand-rolled grid does not, both measured on a real hand-roll:

    **Every label is placed from the image's REAL rect**, read back after placement, never from the
    cell frame. The hand-roll put every column header and every per-cell metric 0.672in from the
    panel it named — and no lint could catch it: `CAPTION NOT ALIGNED` bails on a multi-row grid,
    because the next image row falls inside its caption scan band.

    **One aspect ratio governs the whole grid** — the median of the images' own. The cell is then
    built at that ratio, so `fit="contain"` and `fit="cover"` coincide and there is ZERO letterbox
    and ZERO crop by construction; neither operation is ever performed. The hand-roll wasted 65% of
    every cell to letterbox; `photo_triptych` takes the other branch and silently crops 12–24% off
    scientific data. Images that do not share that ratio are REFUSED rather than fudged (`ar_tol`):
    mixed aspect ratios cannot align rows AND columns, and the honest fix is a common FOV crop.

    Returns the grid's ACTUALLY USED rect `(x, y, w, h)` in inches — it is aspect-locked, so it
    rarely fills a 16:9 region, and the caller wants the leftover for the so-what (`takeaway_rail`).

    `metrics` are pre-formatted STRINGS ("34.6", never 34.6): a float would need a `value_fmt`
    parameter and re-open the format-dialect bug class. Keep them ≤11pt so a dozen per-cell numbers
    stay chrome and do not drag the deck's body median into `SMALL TYPE`.

    moves that are ordinary editorial design — a giant display word with a small line riding it, and
    background geometry running through a paragraph — and there was no way to say "this one is on
    purpose". Measured: both compositions were refused at build time, so the deck could not be saved
    at all.

    `ghost_numeral` is excluded from the old-style-figures check by an exact tag, with the reason

    watermark." The same logic holds here. A size or opacity heuristic would wave through a real
    collision on the day a title happened to be large.

    `reason` is required and must be a sentence someone can disagree with later, because that is what
    separates a decision from a reflex — and the count of declared overlaps is printed by the lint,

    magnitude is never faked across incompatible units). The strongest form for a results /
    scoreboard slide: the GAP is the message (`form-selection.md`).

    rows = [(name, sub_or_"", v_before, v_after, scale_lo, scale_hi, unit), ...] — set lo/hi per
    row (pad ~10%); improvements where lower-is-better simply have v_after left of v_before.
    An optional **8th element** per row, ``v_mid``, draws a small neutral mid dot on the track
    (an intermediate checkpoint — e.g. an interim release between before and after) with its
    value labelled above the dot when it clears the end labels, else below the track.
    **Value labels are direction-aware and always placed OUTWARD** of the dumbbell span: a
    rightward row keeps the classic before-left / after-right geometry; a leftward
    (lower-is-better) row mirrors it, so the labels cannot collide at any span.
    `hero` = row index to emphasise (left accent bar + bold name) · `threshold` = optional
    (row_idx, value, tick_label) drawing a vertical reference tick on that row (e.g. the 100%
    line NRR must cross). **`regress`** = a set/list of row indices that got WORSE — their after-dot,
    connector, and value recolour to the risk red and the value gets a ▾ mark, so a mixed board
    doesn't paint a regression in the celebratory 'improved' accent (colour is never the only
    signal — the number and the ▾ carry it too). `label_w` defaults to the MEASURED widest row
    label (capped), so short metric names don't strand a huge empty gutter — pass it for very long

    THE FORM. One square = one thing. It is how you make a count *felt* rather than read — "34
    paintings" is a number, thirty-four squares is a quantity you can see is small. It is also the
    honest way to show a tiny share: a 1%-of-1000 sliver on a bar is a hairline, but one dark cell
    in a field of a hundred is unmistakable. Reach for it when the count IS the point (a lifetime's
    output, survivors, 3 of 12 experiments) and for the "N in 100" framing. Do NOT use it when the
    total is large and arbitrary — 8,412 cells is a texture, not a count.

    WHY IT IS HERE. This was the one editorial form the catalogue lacked, and its absence was
    measured: a narrative deck hand-rolled a 34-square grid out of `box` in a loop with a literal
    stride, which is the exact geometry defect `check_handrolled_pitch` exists to catch. The
    catalogue skewed to business/data forms (leaderboard, funnel, scorecard), so a humanities deck
    fell out of it entirely and back onto primitives.

    ``unit_label`` IS POSITIONAL AND REQUIRED, on purpose. A field of identical squares is
    meaningless until the viewer is told what one square is, and that sentence has to be on the
    slide, not in the caption below or in the speaker's mouth. Passing an empty one raises: a
    decorative grid of squares is precisely the un-decodable "frame furniture" this skill treats as
    a defect. Write the unit, e.g. ``"一个方块 = 一幅公认真迹"`` / ``"1 square = 1 shipped feature"``.

    Cells are square and sized to the LARGEST that fits ``w`` x ``h`` (the label's line included in
    the budget), sweeping every column count rather than guessing one. Cell size and stride are
    DERIVED from the region, never constants. Returns bottom y, always <= ``y + h``.

    Each row scales to its OWN maximum (KPIs carry different units, so a shared axis would crush the
    small ones — CSAT 0–5 next to Revenue 0–150), with qualitative BANDS (poor / ok / good) shaded
    behind a MEASURE bar (accent) to ``actual`` and a TARGET tick — so gap-to-goal AND 'which band it
    lands in' read as geometry, not a caption.

    ``rows = [(label, actual, target), ...]`` — or ``(label, actual, target, [b1, b2])`` with per-row
    ABSOLUTE band thresholds. Otherwise ``bands`` gives the zone edges as FRACTIONS of each row's max
    (default ``(0.6, 0.85)`` → <60% poor / 60–85% ok / >85% good); ``bands=None`` draws a plain track.
    ``higher_better=False`` reverses the band shading for 'lower is better' KPIs (churn, latency).
    Returns the bottom y. The dashboard bar ``scorecard``/``meter_bar`` can't give — those carry a
    value(+delta) but no plan line and no thresholds. Reuses ``axis_scale`` per row so the measure bar
    always fits its track. Only reach for it when each KPI has a REAL target/plan line (without one use
    ``scorecard``/``meter_bar``). Assumes non-negative actual/target; on a DARK deck pass ``band_colors``

    """The face a run's glyphs will ACTUALLY be set in — which is not always `run.font.name`.

    python-pptx's `font.name` reads `<a:latin>`. CJK glyphs render from `<a:ea>`, which is where
    `_apply_ea`/`set_font` put the East-Asian face. So on a Chinese deck every geometry check measured
    Chinese text with the deck's LATIN metrics, and Latin metrics are roughly half as wide as a
    full-width glyph:

        「给准备申请的人——学位、博士、岗位，三扇门分别长什么样」 at 13pt, true width 4.875in
            Hiragino Sans GB  4.8750in   (exact)
            Songti SC         4.8750in   (exact)
            Helvetica Neue    2.6181in   (54% — what every check was using)

    The width model was never wrong; the FACE handed to it was. That under-measurement is why a
    CJK page can collide after a generous-looking margin was left, and why nudging coordinates
    gives feedback that does not match intuition — the ruler is short, so the operator blames
    their own arithmetic. It reaches `TEXT_OVERLAP`, `OFF_CANVAS`, `ESCAPES_CARD`, `FOOTER` and
    every `measure_*` helper, i.e. essentially all of this file's geometry on a Chinese deck.

    Resolved through `_inherited_ea` rather than `run.font.name`'s ea twin, because a supplied CJK
    template normally sets the face one level up (paragraph `defRPr` / the shape's `lstStyle`) —
    the same chain `retrofit_ea` and `CJK_NO_EA` already walk, so all three agree by construction.
    A Latin run is unaffected: it returns `font.name` exactly as before.

    writes `(title, 40, INK, True, False, "Songti SC")` has set the Latin face of a run whose Latin
    content is a stray acronym, and every Chinese character in it still renders in EAFONT. Measured

    swapping the run tuple's font changed none of the CJK glyphs. The declared display face reached

    Every other geometric check in this file asks whether the page is readable. This one asks
    whether it is TRUE, which is a different question and the only one where a passing deck can
    still mislead the room. Bar length is a proportion claim: if two bars sit in one group, the
    reader reads their ratio, and a truncated baseline turns 1.5 vs 2.1 into 1 : 7 while every
    legibility, overflow and contrast check stays green.

    Nothing here needs judgment — `extent / |value|` is either constant across the group or it is
    not. Measured on a delivered 12-page deck whose two hand-drawn charts were correct, the
    constant held to 1.0003 and 1.0000, so the 2% tolerance below is not a tuned threshold with a
    deck sitting near it; it is two orders of magnitude of headroom over the rounding a correct
    build produces.

    🔴 This is PREVENTIVE, and that is worth saying plainly: unlike the other checks added
    recently, no instance of this defect has been found in this skill's own output. What is real
    is the effort it displaces — the design critic hand-computed a bar ratio on a delivered deck
    (`1.5 bar 198px / 2.1 bar 279px = 0.710 ≈ 1.5/2.1`), which is arithmetic paid for at model
    prices, in a dispatch that might not do it next time.

    It sees only what is TAGGED, via `bar_scale()` or `mark_datum()`. An untagged bar is
    unchecked, not assumed correct — the check cannot recover a number the author never wrote
    down, and guessing which printed number belongs to which rectangle produced garbage pairings
    on 4 of 6 real chart pages when it was tried.

    """ASSET NOT USABLE — a picture that arrived but cannot carry anything.

    Every asset gate in this skill so far asks whether a planned asset was USED (the icon waiver,
    form reach, carried_by, palette drift). None asks whether the file that got used is any good,
    and a file existing is not proof that acquiring it succeeded: a failed generation commonly
    returns a truncated download or a flat placeholder plate, and a cropped export can come back
    fully transparent. All three embed without complaint, render as a blank rectangle, and pass
    every geometric, contrast and density check — the picture occupies its box, so nothing even
    reads the page as underfilled.

    Three states, each unusable for a different reason:
      · the blob does not decode — PowerPoint shows a broken-image placeholder;
      · every pixel is transparent — the shape is a hole in the layout with a caption under it;
      · one colour covers effectively the whole frame — a generation placeholder or an empty
        canvas. A genuinely flat image is not a picture anyone needs: `box()` draws that.

    Sampled at 64x64 NEAREST, so a pure colour stays pure and a photograph cannot be flattened
    into one by resampling. Icons are the case to NOT break: they are mostly transparent by
    construction, so the transparency rule asks for FULL transparency, and the flat-colour rule
    measures the opaque pixels only.

    (`h - FOOTER_BAND`). Those are different questions, so a low text block passed the cheap
    build-time loop BY CONSTRUCTION and failed the expensive render-time one — measured on a real
    build: five consecutive build+render rounds where the build said clean and the render said
    FOOTER-ZONE intrusion, three of them refused by the LOOP BREAKER for nudging constants at a
    fault the fast loop could not see.

    🔴 AND THE TWO INK MODELS DISAGREE, in the direction that hurts. Measured across five strings
    and sizes: `lint_deck._rbox` reads 0.020-0.040in LOWER than `deckkit._ink_rect`, and the
    render-time check then adds a further 0.04 pad — so an author who designs to `_ink_rect`,
    which this skill explicitly tells them to do, lands inside the render-time failure band with
    room to spare. `FOOTER_BAND_PAD` closes that: this check fires slightly EARLIER than the
    render-time one, never later, so a build-time pass implies a render-time pass on this class.
    An estimate that is correct is not the same as one with margin.

    The carves mirror lint_deck's exactly — a declared lower/bleed envelope, a small textless

    """Faults that are invisible one slide at a time — both measured on a real delivered deck.

    `lint_layout`'s other checks all reason about ONE slide's geometry, and these two cannot be
    seen that way: the first is about two shapes on a page saying the same thing, the second is
    about a page disagreeing with the REST of the deck. Both are WARN rather than CRITICAL, which
    is the honest severity for a new check — a legitimate repeat (a comparison whose labels rhyme,
    a deliberately re-anchored chrome line on one divider) must never block a build.

    DUPLICATE TEXT — the same non-trivial string rendered by two separate top-level shapes on one
    slide. Measured causes, all real: a build script patched repeatedly left an ORPHANED copy of a
    layout drawing over the new one, so the page ran two layouts at once and its coordinates never
    moved however the source was edited; a component's own auto-label printed beside a hand-written
    one, so a single quantity appeared twice at two different roundings; a programme named in a
    list and then again as the hub of a diagram beneath it. None of these is visible in a
    per-shape check, and every one of them shipped past a clean lint.

    CHROME SLOT DRIFT — a repeated chrome line (the per-slide source note) that does not sit where
    the rest of the deck puts it. Measured: 11 source lines, 8 pinned to one slot and 3 placed
    wherever their page's last block happened to end — one of them rendering "as of <date>" inside
    a diagram box. The rule "pin the chrome" was prose; prose held 8 times out of 11.

    """Build-time GEOMETRY self-check. Walk every shape on every slide — HOWEVER it was placed,
    manual coords or the grid/stack helpers — and report the high-signal faults that otherwise
    cost a whole visual-critic round. Reasons about each text box's INK rectangle (where glyphs
    land), so it stays quiet on the generously-sized frames real builds use:

      OFF_CANVAS   — a text box's INK, or a card/table, extends past the slide edge. Full-bleed
                     PICTURES (and giant watermark numerals) are exempt — they're meant to bleed.
      OVERFLOW     — a VISIBLE (filled/outlined) text box whose ink needs more height/width than it has.
      ESCAPES_CARD — a text box's ink / a figure / a labelled node pokes outside the FILLED card or
                     panel that encloses its centre (the "bullet ran past the bottom of its card" bug).
                     The host is the SMALLEST filled rect-panel that contains the child and is bigger
                     than it; full-bleed backgrounds and picture/outline-only cards are never hosts.
      TEXT_OVERLAP — two text boxes' INK rectangles overlap materially (real text-on-text). Text
                     layered over a fill/photo is fine and NOT flagged; faint watermark numerals
                     (>=50pt, e.g. ghost_numeral) are excluded as the decorative background they are.
      FOOTER       — a content text's ink, or a card, reaches the actual footer chrome row (keyed to
                     the real footer; a footer-less slide relies on OFF_CANVAS + the Step-5 lint_deck).
      OFFCENTER    — a card whose ONLY content is a single line of text leaves a lopsided top/bottom
                     gap (one line in a block reads best vertically centred — anchor it MIDDLE).
      SLIVER_GAP   — two panels (or a panel and a picture) NEARLY touch: their projections overlap
                     on one axis and the edge gap on the other is a sliver (0.005–0.10in — clearly
                     below the documented ~0.12in "≥ ~⅓ GUTTER" floor, so rule-compliant gaps never
                     warn). The classic cause is a hand-picked stack pitch that barely clears the
                     block height (pitch 1.04, height 1.02 → a ~0.02in seam). Flush/contained/
                     overlapping pairs (g ≤ 0) stay lint_deck.py's domain.

    Returns findings = [(slide_no, severity, code, msg)]. `verbose` prints a compact report;
    `strict=True` raises if any CRITICAL remains (headless / CI). Stays deliberately silent on what
    needs PIXELS not geometry (text on a busy image, contrast, balance, z-order, a figure smothering
    bullets) and on shapes inside GROUPS — all the visual critic's / lint_deck.py's job.

    Low false positives is the whole point (a noisy gate adds reviewer burden). The caveat: the
    wrap-dependent checks measure with the text's font, so when that font ISN'T installed and
    measurement falls back to a wider face, near-threshold flags carry ~1 line of slack and a one-time
    note is printed — i.e. every CRITICAL it prints is real WHEN the deck's fonts are available, and
    conservative (may under-flag a 1-line overrun) when they're substituted."""

# ============================================ isometric 2.5D (native — no generated image)
#
# DESIGN DECISIONS, fixed here so every 2.5D element in a deck reads as one system:
#   PROJECTION — true isometric (30 degrees), parallel not perspective. x = width -> right-and-down,
#     y = depth -> left-and-down, z = height -> straight up. Parallel projection is the right call
#     for slides: it is deterministic, tiles cleanly, and never distorts a value (a perspective bar
#     chart would foreshorten the far bars and lie about the data).
#   FACE SHADING — top = the base colour (brightest, catches the light); the right face (y=0) at
#     x0.80; the left face (x=0) at x0.55. One light source, upper-front. These three ratios are the
#     whole "3D" illusion; keep them fixed so a prism on slide 3 matches a slab on slide 9.
#   TEXT — python-pptx cannot shear text onto an isometric face, so labels sit BESIDE the geometry,
#     never on it. A value/label is placed at the shape's top-centre or to its side in flat type.
#     This is a hard limit of the medium, not a style choice; do not fake sheared text with rotation.
#   DOSE — 2.5D is eye-catching and cheap to overuse. It earns its place on a stack/hierarchy/one
#     hero chart, not on every slide (the same discipline as generated imagery). iso_bars is FAITHFUL
#     (height is linear in the value, zero-based) so it never becomes decoration that distorts data.

    "$40B of equity out -> five AI labs -> compute committed back" needs no column bookkeeping.

    The one rule that makes this a chart rather than decoration: **every width uses ONE scale.**
    `units_per_inch` is derived from the BUSIEST column, so a ribbon twice as thick carries twice
    the value, everywhere in the diagram. A flow picture whose widths do not match its numbers is
    not a stylistic choice, it is a false chart -- the same class of defect as a bar chart with a
    cropped axis, and harder to catch because nobody thinks to check it.

    `x, y, w, h` is the WHOLE region including labels, so it can be handed a region straight from
    `content_band`/`columns`/`rows` and nothing lands outside. `label_w` is reserved at each side for the first
    and last columns' labels; middle columns are labelled in the gap ABOVE each node (which is
    why `gap` and the top headroom are widened automatically when middle columns exist) -- text
    over a ribbon would be unreadable, and a chip behind it would hide the flow it sits on.

    Reach for it when the story is CIRCULATION (money out and back, a supply chain, a budget

    (a flat task index) recolours one bar. **Fails loudly** (``ValueError``) if a bar falls off the
