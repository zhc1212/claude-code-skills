# ── BATCHED GATE REPORTING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `die()` used to be what it looks like: print one message, exit. On the hand-off gate that made
# every run report exactly ONE problem, and a thin `.deck-gates.json` then costs one fail → fix →
# re-run round-trip PER FIELD — measured shape: ~15 sequential stop classes (critic → build_shape
# → boldness → design_plan fields → type_scale → signature_proof → carried_by → concept →
# signature_move → form reach → arc → provenance → sameness → density), each round-trip re-sending
# the whole conversation at hand-off-time context, which is the most expensive point of the run.
# The repo already knew this: `codex_delivery_gate.py` accumulates an `errors` list and prints all
# of it, and `validate_review.py`'s docstring names "the ping-pong of one-error-at-a-time retries"
# as the anti-pattern it was built to avoid. This path was the only holdout.
#
# So in batching mode `die()` records the failure and raises `_GateStop`, which ends the CURRENT
# gate section (its remaining checks genuinely depend on what just failed) and lets every OTHER
# section still run. `check_handoff_gates` prints the whole list at the end. Nothing about the
# messages, the thresholds or the exit code changes — only how many runs it takes to see them.
#
# `_GateStop` derives from BaseException, like SystemExit and for the same reason: several gates
# call `die()` inside a `try/except Exception`, and an ordinary exception would be swallowed there
# — turning a hard gate into a silent pass. That is the one way this change could have made the
# file WORSE than the behaviour it replaces.

# "not category-rich" no longer clears it — that was the casual skip this set closes. Each names a
# case where an icon family would genuinely HURT, not just be optional:
#   motif-dominant     a strong constructed motif icons would dilute (the ≤3-loud motif budget)
#   editorial-register a data / editorial register (FT/Economist) icons would cheapen into corporate

#   template-locked    a registered/provided template that carries its own marks or forbids them
# 🔴 They are NOT a licence to drop icons from the CATEGORICAL slides that do have them — a deck may
# be motif-dominant AND still put icons on its one roster page. The category explains the REST.
#   user-declined     the USER asked for no icons. It is their deck; this is not a taste

    Building a user profile from scratch is most of what a headless `--convert-to` run spends
    its time on: measured 3.71s per export with a fresh profile against 2.16s once the profile
    already exists — ~42% of the export, on every render, spent recreating the same directory.

    The old code paid that every time by design, and the design had two real reasons, both of
    which this pool has to keep:

      1. **Parallel renders must not fight.** The large-deck section fan-out renders several
         decks at once, and two `soffice` processes pointed at ONE profile collide: measured,
         one of the pair exits 1 having written no PDF at all.
      2. **The user's own LibreOffice may be open.** A render must not touch the GUI's profile.

    So this is a POOL, not a shared singleton: N private slots, each held under an exclusive
    `flock` for the duration of one render. Concurrent renders land on different slots; a slot
    is only ever used by one process at a time, which is exactly the invariant a throwaway
    profile gave for free. Nothing here goes near LibreOffice's default profile.

    When every slot is busy, or the platform has no `flock` (Windows), or anything at all goes
    wrong, we hand back a throwaway profile — i.e. precisely the old behaviour. The pool is an
    optimization; it is never the reason a deck fails to render.

# value — every image description written for a screen reader stops at the .pptx. With
# `PDFUACompliance` the same deck exports with `pdfuaid` and the descriptions present, as UTF-16
# `/Alt` strings. The raster is BYTE-IDENTICAL (checked: same sha over the page pixmap) and the

# --- parallel rasterization -------------------------------------------------------------
# Rasterizing is the one render stage that is embarrassingly parallel: each page is an
# independent draw into its own file. It is also, on an image-heavy deck, the stage that
# actually costs something.
#
# Two things about the shape below are load-bearing, both measured rather than reasoned:
#
#  1. **Chunk contiguously; open the PDF ONCE per worker.** The obvious version — one task
#     per page — was measured at 18.5s against 2.9s serial on a 16-page image deck: 6.5x
#     SLOWER, because every task re-opens and re-parses the whole PDF. Chunked, the same
#     deck rasterizes in 1.27s (4 workers).
#  2. **Never let this fail a render.** It is an optimization on a step that already worked.
#     Any failure — no process pool in a locked-down sandbox, a worker dying, pickling
#     trouble — returns False and the caller runs the original serial loop. A deck that
#     renders slower is a nuisance; a deck that does not render is a broken run.
#
# Verified byte-identical to the serial loop (sha256 over every PNG, text and image decks).
# `SLIDE_MAKER_RENDER_WORKERS=1` forces the serial path.
RASTER_MIN_PAGES = 8          # below this the pool costs more than the pages save
RASTER_MAX_WORKERS = 4        # measured: 4 workers ~= 8 workers (1.27s vs 1.25s), half the RAM
# Page COUNT was the wrong gate on its own: what a worker pool saves is DECODE work, and a page's
# decode cost is set by its weight, not by how many neighbours it has. Measured serial rasterize:
#
#     18-page text/CJK deck   2.5-5.5 KB/page,  0 images   0.05-0.08s   (2.9-4.7 ms/page)
#     16-page image deck       84.5 KB/page,   16 images   0.47s        (29.3 ms/page)
#
# Fanning out costs ~70 ms in process starts and `import fitz` per worker, so on the text decks the
# pool spent more than the whole job — measured +2.1% wall clock, i.e. the optimization ran and made
# the render slower. On the image deck it is a clear -11.4%. PDF bytes-per-page separates the two by
# ~15x, which is a wide enough margin that a threshold in the middle is not a tuned constant: below
# it there is not enough decode work to pay a single process start, whatever the page count.
# This changes only WHICH path runs; both are already asserted byte-identical by
# tests/test_render_parallel.py, so a mis-set threshold costs milliseconds and never a wrong PNG.

    the whole chunk is done — because a page's thumbnail is not independent of whether that
    page was rendered at 2x first. Measured: `thumb_first` of an image-heavy deck hashes
    differently when rendered from a fresh document than when rendered after the 2x pass
    (both individually deterministic). MuPDF is scaling a cached decode in one case and
    doing a scaled decode in the other. So the thumbnail follows its page into the worker,

    So put the check where the incentive is. `--deliverables` produces the PDF and the preview
    page — the artifacts the user actually asked for — which makes it the one step nobody skips.
    Requiring evidence *here* costs nothing on a deck that ran its loop and blocks the shortcut on
    one that didn't.

    Evidence lives in `<deck-dir>/.deck-gates.json`:

        {"critic": {"verdict": "consent", "rounds": 2, "review": "reviews/r2.json"},
         "provenance": {"claims": [{"claim": "<the claim>", "verdict": "CONFIRMED",
                                    "url": "https://<primary source>"}]}}

    (A summary tally like {"checked": 87} is REJECTED on purpose — a tally is written by the same
    pass that would have skipped the refutation.)

    A gate may be waived — quick decks exist — but a waiver is a written reason that travels with
    the deck AND names which kind of skip it is, not a silence:

        {"critic": {"waived": "1-slide fix to an already-reviewed deck",

        # states the two-token rule -- a hue used as TEXT must itself clear 4.5:1, so keep a bright
        # FILL token and a darker TEXT twin. The rule is correct and still easy to break, because

        # different pair, and each surfaced at render time or in review, a round later.

        # 🔴 THE VERDICT IS RECOMPUTED HERE, NOT READ. The first version required `chosen` + one
        # `rejected` with a clause + a `divergence` string, and its own comment said the quiet part:
        # "`picked contribution-first` on its own is a sentence anyone can write without a competition
        # having happened". The fix it chose — demand the losers and their clauses — raised the price
        # of fabricating the record without making it impossible, because every one of those fields is
        # still prose the run authors about itself.
        #
        # Measured on a delivered deck: `content.arc.divergence` was the two-character string "ok",
        # `chosen`/`rejected` were filled in plausibly at build time, the gate passed, and
        # `arc_divergence.py` had never been invoked for that deck. The session transcript shows three
        # invocations on the one deck that had a real interview and zero on the two that were
        # delegated. A gate that reads a verdict is a gate the run can dictate to.
        #
        # So the gate takes the CANDIDATES and runs `arc_divergence.check()` itself. Faking it now
        # requires authoring 2-3 arcs that mechanically diverge on four axes and each carry comparable
        # ledger evidence — which is not a cheaper way to pass, it is the work. Same move `e7336e6`
        # made for icons ("ask the FILE, so the check survives a run that writes no record"), applied
        # to the costliest Step-1 decision in the pipeline.

    ten iterations, each one driven by an advisory, each one making the deck flatter — the dark
    pivot page deleted for ONE-OFF CANVAS FLIP, content cut for TEXT WALL, the type scale collapsed
    for SIZE SPRAWL. Every one of those advisories names the ambitious repair FIRST ("enrich with a
    second column of substance", "repeat the treatment as a divider family"); subtraction is simply
    the cheaper way to make the number go away, and with feedback on one side only, the cheap way
    always wins. The user's verdict on that deck was "设计能力变弱了" — and NOTHING in the pipeline
    had said so, because the one force that could (the critic's distinctiveness axis) is
    non-blocking at the default dial and lives inside a review that can be declined.

    Shaped exactly like the sameness gate, for the same reason: several weak signals, a structural
    requirement, a size floor, and a waiver that must NAME the register. It blocks at >= 2 codes
    with >= 1 structural — TIMID COVER and FLAT TYPE are one fact counted twice, so type drama
    alone can never hold a deck.

    It stands down entirely under `boldness: conservative` with a recorded `deliberately
