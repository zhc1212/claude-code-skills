"""Guard the DESIGN stack's cross-references and shared numbers.

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured. A whole-skill audit found that the design pipeline's *rules* were sound
and its *indexing* had drifted. Every defect was a count, a range, a letter or a token list — the
one class of content that no artifact and no check ever re-derives, so it rots silently:

  · `agents/slide-design.md` declared "Design self-verify (a-q)" in two places while the list ran
    to (r). Item (r) landed 2026-07-27; the header was written 2026-07-22 and never updated. (r) is
    the density line — the ONE self-verify item with a hard deterministic backstop. An art director
    sweeping "a through q" licenses itself to stop one item short of the gated one.
  · PRE-FLIGHT 12(a) said the form-family ceiling was ">~40%" while eight other files said
    "~40-50%", so a 45% card family passed Step 2 and the critic and then failed a post-build tick
    that has no justification arm.
  · SKILL.md's DESIGN checkpoint named `direction gate:` and dropped branch (d)'s `style gate:`;
    `interior register:` was required by self-verify (q), PRE-FLIGHT 6b and the critic contract card
    and appeared nowhere in the file SKILL.md names as the OWNER of the checkpoint's required lines.

None of these is catchable by reading — they are agreements between files. They are all decidable by
a program, which is where the skill's own layering doctrine says they belong. So:

    python3 scripts/check_design_contracts.py            # exit 1 on any drift
    python3 scripts/check_design_contracts.py --selftest # prove the checks can still fail

Exit 0 = the design stack's indexes agree. Exit 1 = named drift. Exit 2 = could not run, which is
never the same as clean.
