"""Citations for an academic deck: read from the .bib, never retyped — and never invented.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A defense, a journal club, a lab meeting and a grant talk all cite, and every
citation on those slides was, until now, a string somebody typed onto a slide by hand. Measured
across this skill before this file: `sources_page` renders a list of STRINGS and `source_note`
renders a provenance line of STRINGS; nothing read a bibliography, nothing linked an in-text marker
to a reference list, and nothing could tell a correct year from a remembered one. Retyping is
exactly where a year drifts by one and an author gets dropped — and on a slide, a misattributed
result is a claim about a real person's work.

So the bibliography is the source of truth: `parse_bibtex` reads it, `in_text` and
`format_reference` derive the marker and the line from the SAME entry, and
`scripts/check_citations.py` checks the built deck against it. Nothing here accepts a hand-typed
reference, because a hand-typed reference is the failure this file exists for.

🔴 IT REFUSES RATHER THAN FILLING IN. An entry with no author, no title or no year is not formatted
with `n.d.` or `Anon.` — it raises, naming the key and the field. Under this skill's never-invent
floor, a plausible-looking citation is worse than a missing one: a reader cannot tell it from a real
one, and neither can the author six months later.

The two styles are SLIDE reference lines — enough for a reader to identify the work and find it —
not a journal's copy-edited style. A deck is not a manuscript; if a venue demands exact APA/IEEE
punctuation, the manuscript is where that belongs.

    `entries` is the ordered list of parsed entries (numeric markers are their 1-based positions).
    Built on the same mono/accent chrome as `deckkit.sources_page`, which takes plain strings; this
    takes bibliography entries, so the line on the slide cannot drift from the .bib.

    🔴 `link_style="ink"` (the default) sets the DECK's hyperlink colour to `ink` and drops the
    underline, because a renderer paints a linked run in the theme's hyperlink colour whatever fill
    the run itself carries. Measured on a rendered page: the two entries that happened to have a DOI
    came out in bright underlined blue and the third in the deck's navy — one list, two typographies,
    decided by whether a field existed in the .bib. `link_style="theme"` leaves the theme alone.
