"""The markers on the slides, the reference list, and the .bib must be the SAME three things.

An academic deck fails at citation in four ways, and all four are computable from the built file
plus the bibliography it claims to cite:

  * a marker on a slide that resolves to nothing — `[7]` over a six-entry list, the classic
    leftover from a cut slide, and the one an audience member WILL look up;
  * a reference list entry nothing cites — padding, and in a defense it reads as padding;
  * a reference list that was planned and never rendered, so the markers point at a page that is
    not in the deck;
  * an entry the bibliography cannot support — no author, no title, no year — which is where a
    retyped citation quietly becomes a misattribution.

The record names the bibliography and the keys, in the order they are cited:

  "content": {"citations": {"bib": "refs.bib", "style": "numeric",
                            "keys": ["lustig2007", "schlemper2018"]}}

`scripts/citations.py` derives both the marker and the reference line from the SAME entry, so this
gate never compares a slide against a second hand-typed copy — the failure it exists to catch.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. No `content.citations` -> NOT CHECKED. Most decks cite nothing, and a gate
that demanded a bibliography of every deck would teach authors to record an empty one.
