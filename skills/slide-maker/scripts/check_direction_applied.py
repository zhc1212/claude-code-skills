"""The direction the user PICKED must be the direction that shipped.

WHY. The branch-(c) gate renders four directions, the user clicks one, and the choice is recorded
as a sentence on the design checkpoint's `direction gate:` line. Nothing then compared the BUILT
deck to the direction that was picked. Measured on a real delivered deck: the chosen direction
declared a Georgia display face and a centred cover; the deck shipped with Helvetica Neue titles
and a low-left cover, because `style.py` set `display=` and every title passed `dk.FONT`, so the
DISPLAY slot was never read. The author reported it — "我选的 B 和实际最终模版并不一样" — and no
gate had anything to say, while two neighbouring checks in this same repo already existed for the
identical class of failure: `check_register_pixels` (a declared colour must reach the pixels) and
`check_style_applied` (a declared preset must actually be called).

WHAT IT COMPARES. Only what a machine can settle from the file:

    ground     the deck's own background colour vs the direction's `bg`
    accent     the direction's `accent` must APPEAR somewhere in the deck
    display    the typeface of the largest text run vs the direction's `display`
    body       the typeface of the body-size runs vs the direction's `body`
    cover      `centred` vs `low-left`, measured from the cover's largest text block

Composition beyond those two named values, motif and skeleton are NOT checked and say so: a
"skeleton: island" is a judgement, and a check that guesses at one is worse than a check that
names its own limit.

A DELIBERATE deviation is legitimate and common — the freshness rule can move a ground, a
contrast floor can move an accent. It is recorded in writing, per axis:

    "design_plan": {"direction_deviations": {"bg": "the freshness gate measured the picked
                     value as a repeat of a recent deck's"}}

An unrecorded one is what this exists to catch, because that is the version the user cannot see.

    Measured on a real deck: a 0.90in-left, 11.53in-wide title box scored 50.0% with its

    is used here rather than re-derived, because a second copy of a geometry model is how this
