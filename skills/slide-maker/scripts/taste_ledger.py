"""The TASTE LEDGER — what this user has already taught, so the next deck does not relearn it.

🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. Every deck starts from zero. The skill has 39 references and 60-odd tests, and
none of them remember a single thing the user actually said. Measured, from one user's own history,
the SAME correction arriving on deck after deck:

    "为什么这个slide没有icon"                     — icons missing, found by the user at hand-off
    "设计能力变弱了"                                — a deck of grey blocks
    "尺子这个确实有些太impressive了,可以用block之类的"  — a motif that overpowered its content
    "对于实验室或者会议场景,ppt的默认字体应该是…"      — a type default, corrected by hand

Each cost a delivery to discover. Each was then forgotten. This is the difference between a skill
that is *configured* and a skill that *learns*: without it, the user is the memory, and paying that
tax is what "从零开始" actually feels like from their side.

🔴 WHY IT IS SELF-LIMITING, AND WHY THAT MATTERS MOST. A ledger that only grows becomes noise, and
noise is indistinguishable from having no ledger. So an entry that earns a DETERMINISTIC GATE is
retired and points at it:

    add → the rule binds by being read at the step it applies to   (soft, costs attention)
    retire --gate CODE → the rule binds by being checked            (hard, costs nothing)

That is this skill's own enforcement invariant ("every 🔴 MUST must be wired into a gate artifact")
applied to taste: **the ledger is the holding pen for user-taught rules that do not have a gate
yet.** Entries leave by being promoted, not by being forgotten.

🔴 WHAT KEEPS IT FROM BECOMING VIBES. Three required fields, each blocking:
  - `quote`        — the user's own words. Not your summary of them. A rule with no quote is
                     something you decided and attributed to them.
  - `learned_from` — which deck, and when. A rule with no origin cannot be re-examined when it
                     stops being true, and taste does change.
  - `binds_at`     — the pipeline step that must read it. A rule that binds nowhere is a note.

STORAGE. The DATA is per-user and lives outside the repo (default `~/.slide-maker/taste-ledger.json`,
override with `$SLIDE_MAKER_TASTE_LEDGER`); the MECHANISM ships in the repo. A user's verbatim
feedback is theirs and does not belong in a public git history.
