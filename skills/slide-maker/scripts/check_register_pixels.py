"""The register a deck declares must reach its PIXELS — and must not be the last deck's.

SKILL.md states two rules that survive no matter what: **never ship deckkit's default blue, and
never reuse the last deck's scheme.** Both were prose. What existed instead:

  * `check_style_applied.py` verifies the CALL — `presets.apply("brutalist")` appearing in the
    build script. A deck that calls it and then hand-sets the tokens back to stock passes, and a
    **bespoke** register (no preset call at all) is skipped by definition. Measured: the deck built
    in this repo's own session set its whole register by hand, and nothing verified it landed.
  * The sameness lint measures monotony WITHIN one deck; SKILL.md says so itself — "no gate checks
    that a built deck EXPRESSES its register".
  * Freshness against past decks lived in one prose line of `taste.md`, with nothing scoring it.

The sibling skill already learned the lesson this file applies: its null-DNA gate hashes real
renders because "that is a claim about real CSS in a real browser, so it is checked by hashing real
renders — not by asserting that a variable is present." A palette is the same kind of claim.

So this reads the RENDERED PNGs and asks three questions a source-level check cannot:

  STOCK REGISTER SHIPPED   deckkit's own identity colours dominate the pages while the palette the
                           plan declares is nowhere on them — the "default blue" rule, measured.
  DECLARED PALETTE ABSENT  the plan names colours the render does not contain (a bespoke register
                           that never reached the build, or a palette rewritten after the fact).
  LAST DECK'S SCHEME       the ground value and the accents match a deck already in `taste.md`'s
                           LOOK HISTORY — the freshness rule, measured across decks instead of
                           asserted in a sentence.

🔴 It judges COLOUR IDENTITY only. It cannot see composition, type, geometry or motif, so a deck
can pass here and still be a stock layout in fresh paint — the critic's distinctiveness axis and
