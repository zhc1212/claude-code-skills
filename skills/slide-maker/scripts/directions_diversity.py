"""Mechanical DIVERGENCE check for direction-gate candidates — the anti-theater gate.

The direction gate asks for "3 *differentiated* directions", and the same agent that wrote them
then judges whether they differ. That is one mind checking itself, and it fails in a specific,
repeatable way: three token sets that are three colourways of one layout, presented as a choice.
This script measures divergence DETERMINISTICALLY from the token sets, per pair, on four axes:

  mode         light/dark, from the background's relative luminance (a mode flip is strong divergence)
  palette      euclidean distance between backgrounds + between accents (the loudest single signal)
  type         the display/body font PAIRING as a class (serif/sans/mono/slab) + whether the deck
               sets a display face apart from its body face at all
  composition  the cover archetype and the content skeleton — WHERE the ink sits. Added because a
               measured real deck showed 8/12 pages sharing one composition signature while its
               FORMS varied correctly: composition was never being chosen, only defaulted.

A pair is TOO SIMILAR when it matches on >=3 of the 4 axes. The response is never an auto-kill:
REDIVERGE the pair, or keep it WITH A NAMED JUSTIFICATION recorded on the `direction gate:` line
(a brand-locked accent is a legitimate reason for a palette match — the shared hue is a mandate,
and divergence then has to move onto the other three axes).

It ALSO enforces the SET's STRUCTURE, not just its pairs. The branch-(c) gate is "3 real styles
(best-fit DNA presets and/or a bespoke register) + 1 colour-scheme option" — so at most ONE
direction may be a *motif-less colourway* (no preset `dna`, no bespoke motif). A set of several bare
colourways passes every PAIRWISE test — each pair can differ on palette/type — while being exactly
the "the options were just different colours" failure the whole preset-driven gate exists to end.
The divergence axes measure whether directions differ FROM EACH OTHER; this measures whether they
carry real style DNA AT ALL. Same escape as the others: keep it and record why on the
`direction gate:` line.

CLI:  python3 directions_diversity.py directions.json [--json]
Exit: 0 = diverse, has a bespoke, and >=3 slots carry real style DNA
      2 = >=1 too-similar pair, OR no bespoke, OR >1 motif-less colourway (all printed)
      1 = unreadable input.
