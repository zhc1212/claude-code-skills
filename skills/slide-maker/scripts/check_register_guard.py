"""A declared register must be OBEYED, not just paletted — the machine-checkable half.

WHY. Measured on this toolchain: the same content run through all 18 `presets.apply()` calls
produced 18 pages that differed only in ground colour, corner radius and rule weight. memphis had
none of its coloured header bands, bauhaus none of its primitives, glassmorphism no glass card.
Every register's real look lives in its `surface` and `guard` fields — precise, executable
sentences — and `apply()` sets only palette, geometry tokens and ground, so the look is executed
by the author reading the prose or not at all.

Nothing measured the difference. `check_register_pixels.py` says so in its own docstring: it
judges COLOUR IDENTITY only. So "declare brutalist, ship its palette on rounded pastel cards"
cleared every gate — the "you just matched a few colours and called it using the template" failure, verifiable and
unverified.

This checks the SHAPE-LEVEL prohibitions, from `presets.FORBIDS`:

    rounded            prstGeom in a rounded family — swiss/brutalist/ink_wash/blueprint set
                       radius=0 precisely because their own guards forbid rounded cards
    gradient           a gradFill anywhere on the shape
    soft-shadow        shadow.inherit left True: the theme's soft shadow, never switched off
    proportional-face  a run in a face outside the mono whitelist (terminal is mono for EVERY run)
    confetti           more than ONE oversized primitive — bauhaus's guard says one hero shape,
                       "never a confetti of shapes (that is memphis)"

🔴 NARROW ON PURPOSE, in two directions. Only 7 of 18 registers declare prohibitions, and only
properties readable straight off the OOXML are listed: "photography carries ALL the colour", "no
diagrams drawn straight on the navy", "no title that isn't a full-sentence conclusion" are real
rules in `guard` and none is decidable without judging meaning. They stay prose. A register with
no `FORBIDS` entry is REPORTED as unchecked, never as clean — and a check that fired on lawful
composition would teach the reflex to waive it, which is the failure this whole area is about.
