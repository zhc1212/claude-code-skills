"""Install slide-maker into every terminal-agent skill directory on this machine.

Run from anywhere:
    python3 scripts/install_skill.py --target all

This copies the current skill folder into:
    ~/.codex/skills/slide-maker     (Codex)
    ~/.claude/skills/slide-maker    (Claude Code)
    ~/.agents/skills/slide-maker    (the host-neutral root `npx skills add` installs into —
                                     Coze CLI and other non-Claude agents read it)

WHY `agents` IS IN THIS LIST
----------------------------
It was not, and the copy there went a whole major version stale in the dark. Measured on one
machine: `~/.agents/skills/slide-maker` sat at 4.9.0 while codex/claude/repo were all at 5.0.0 —
missing `design-by-topic.md`, `bespoke-registers.md` and `written_reason.py`, i.e. the entire
5.0.0 topic-adapted look selection, with `style_pick` appearing ZERO times in its SKILL.md while
the current `render_deck.py --gate-check` requires that field.

`check_version.py` was not broken — run inside the stale copy it correctly printed
"5.0.0 is available (installed: 4.9.0)". The notice went out and nothing could act on it,
because `--target` only accepted {codex, claude, both} and `both` meant the two that were
already current. **A refresh path that cannot reach an install target is the same as no notice
at all**, which is why the target list lives here rather than in a README sentence.

`all` installs into every root whose HOST directory already exists, so it never litters
`~/.agents` onto a machine that does not use that channel; naming a target explicitly always
creates it. Skipped roots are printed with the reason — a silent skip is how this drifted.

NOTE for the `agents` root: `npx skills add` keeps its own `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` with a
`skillFolderHash`. Copying files under it does not update that hash, so `npx skills` may report
the folder as locally modified until you re-run `npx skills add addsumtech/slides_maker`. The
files on disk — which is what the agent actually reads — are correct either way.
