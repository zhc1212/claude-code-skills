"""Generate slide visual plates from image_prompt_manifest.json via the **Codex CLI** — no API key.

For Codex / ChatGPT-subscription users who don't want to provide an OpenAI API key: this shells out
to `codex exec`, which calls Codex's hosted **image_generation** tool (a stable, on-by-default
feature). The generated image lands as base64 in the Codex session rollout
(`~/.codex/sessions/.../rollout-*.jsonl`, an `image_generation_call` payload); the agent decodes it
to the target PNG, and this script verifies it (with a rollout-extraction fallback).

A drop-in alternative to generate_images_openai.py with the SAME manifest format:
    [{"slide": 1, "filename": "hero.png", "prompt": "...", "path"?: "..."}, ...]
Every item is validated before anything is generated: a bare image file name, an output inside
--out-dir (or the manifest's own folder), and a prompt that cannot break out of its data block —
see references/security-and-capabilities.md, *Session data*.

Prereqs: the `codex` CLI installed and logged in (`codex login`); image_generation enabled
(default — check `codex features list`). Slower than the API (one agent turn per image) and the
hosted tool steers size by prompt, so this script asks for the requested orientation in the prompt.

        my shipped hero          38      "technology background"     1
        my shipped plate         18      abstract blue gradient      0
        a cardiac-MRI prompt     18      premium swoosh + bokeh      1
        a garden-brand prompt    15

    So the separation is ~15x and the threshold sits in open space. This counts DENSITY, not
    topic agreement: an earlier version required >=2 shared words with a `--topic` string and
    false-positived on both of my own good prompts, because a prompt says "slide-shaped paper
    cards / vellum / ruler" while a topic line says "PowerPoint deck" -- lexical overlap cannot
    bridge concrete visual nouns to abstract subject nouns. Density needs no topic string and has
    no such failure.

    What it CANNOT do is judge the generated pixels' semantics. It gates the prompt, which is
    where the failure originates, and claims nothing more.
