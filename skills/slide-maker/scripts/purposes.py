"""A registry of DECK PURPOSES — and the content each genre is not finished without.

🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. `references/design-by-purpose.md` carries nine purposes, each a prose recipe
(Type · Palette · Density · Layout · Icons · Signature). Measured by grep, NOTHING consumed it: a
purpose entry could be ignored line by line and no gate would know, so every per-purpose rule in
that file was advisory by construction. And four genres with the hardest conventions were absent
from the list entirely — a grant proposal, a progress/guidance committee, a journal club, and a
clinical case presentation. The last three are among the most common decks an academic makes.

The mechanism is deliberately the SAME ONE `formats.py` already uses for surfaces: a registry
declares the sections a genre cannot be finished without, and `check_purpose.py` looks for them in
the built deck. That precedent exists because of a real finding — "a poster in the billboard style
that reads best is also the style that drops the two things a passer-by cannot reconstruct" — and
the finding generalises: the shape of a genre is exactly what an author under time pressure drops.

🔴 WHAT THIS CHECK IS, AND IS NOT. It asks "does this deck NAME the thing", not "does it do it
well". A deck can name its risks in two words and pass; judging whether the mitigation is credible
is the critic's job and always will be. The cheap catch is the one worth having: a grant deck with
no feasibility slide and a committee deck with no ask are not weak decks, they are decks missing a
section their audience is required to score.

Synonyms are multilingual on purpose — a Chinese deck names the same section in Chinese, and a check that
only knows English would fire on every one of them.
