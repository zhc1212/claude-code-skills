"""Every script, agent and reference must appear in `references/file-inventory.md`.

🔴 WHY. SKILL.md routes agents to that file by name — "Full inventory … is in
`references/file-inventory.md`. Read it whenever you need a capability the *Where things live* table
doesn't already route." A capability missing from it is one an agent cannot find, and the cost falls
hardest on the runtimes that have nothing else to consult: a Claude session can grep `scripts/`, a
Codex or GPT agent following the documented route cannot see what the route never mentions.

MEASURED AT INTRODUCTION, 2026-09-12: **11 of 77 scripts and 11 of 39 references were absent**,
including `deck_cycle.py` (the loop-breaker every build iteration goes through), `run_eval.py` (the
only thing that scores a produced deck), `interview-protocol.md` (all of Step 0) and
`security-and-capabilities.md` (what the skill does to your machine). Nothing reported it, because a
missing entry and a complete file read exactly the same.

This is the same shape as `check_tests_wired.py`: adding the twenty-two fixes today, and the guard
fixes the twenty-third — written by someone who does not know the rule.

A file may be deliberately unlisted — a private helper, a fixture, an experiment. That is a
DECISION someone writes down in ALLOWLIST, not a file quietly sitting outside the index.

    python3 scripts/check_inventory.py           # from the skill directory
    python3 scripts/check_inventory.py --list    # what is indexed and what is not

Exit 0 clean · 1 unlisted files · 2 could not run.
