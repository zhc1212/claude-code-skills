"""check_style_applied — the register a deck DECLARES must be the register it APPLIES.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
-------------------
Both delivery gates already require the declaration. `codex_delivery_gate.py` demands
`design.style_pick` ("<preset|bespoke> for <domain> - beat <rival> - anti-pick avoided:
<cliche>") and `render_deck.py --gate-check` requires the same field in `.deck-gates.json`.
Neither verified it. Measured by grep across all three gate scripts: `presets.apply`,
`set_geometry` and `set_ground` appear in NONE of them. So a deck recording

    "style_pick": "brutalist for engineering - beat blueprint - anti-pick avoided: dark_tech"

built with deckkit's stock defaults passed every gate, on BOTH runtimes. The competition was
run, the winner was written down, and nothing carried it into the build.

That is the same declared-vs-applied shape as the defects inside deckkit itself: `presets.apply`
returned a `bg` nothing painted, and `set_geometry`'s tokens were read by 1 of 181 functions.
Those are fixed and `tests/test_register_expression.py` proves the call now reaches the pixels.
This file connects the other end - that the call happens at all - so the chain runs
declaration -> call -> pixels with no unwatched link.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT HONESTLY DOES NOT
---------------------------------------------
It parses the build script and asserts `presets.apply("<name>")` is called for the preset the
deck declared. It checks the CALL, not the rendered geometry - a build could call apply() and
then override every token by hand. That residue is deliberate: measuring the pixels invites
false positives on legitimate local departures (one page deliberately rounder than the
register), and the pixel half is already covered by test_register_expression.py, which proves
apply() reaches the geometry. A cheap check that is right beats an expensive one that cries
wolf, because a gate everyone learns to waive is worse than no gate.

Only PRESET picks are checked. `bespoke ...`, `generated ...` and `n/a - <locked look>` are
skipped by definition: they are not preset-based, and forcing them through a preset-shaped
check would turn the waiver into a rubber stamp.

    `confidence` is "sure" when the look is known to be preset-based, "unsure" when the pick
    names a preset but also carries a non-preset qualifier. Only "sure" may hard-block.

    WHY THE THREE-WAY ANSWER. The first version answered yes/no from the prose alone and produced
    a FALSE POSITIVE on the Q1(d) generate-a-template branch. `references/codex-runtime.md` says
    the topic contest "runs on the GENERATE-A-TEMPLATE branch too" and governs the generated
    HERO's art-direction, so a legitimate generated-branch pick reads

        "editorial_paper for a poetry course - beat ink_wash - generated hero art-directed by it"

    and the build never calls presets.apply() because the look came out of an image tool. Blocking
    that is worse than the gap it closes: a gate that refuses correct work teaches people to waive
    it, and a waived gate stops guarding the case it was built for. Nothing anywhere records which
    Q1 branch a deck took, so `design_plan.look_source` settles it when present and the prose is
    read conservatively when it is not.
