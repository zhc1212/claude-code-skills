"""The two runtimes must gate the same things, or one of them quietly stops enforcing a floor.

🔴 WHY. This skill delivers through two gate paths over two record schemas — `render_deck.py
--gate-check` reading `.deck-gates.json`, and `codex_delivery_gate.py` reading
`.codex-deck-evidence.json`. They have drifted apart THREE times, each time silently, each time
found by accident:

  1. `png` vs `path` — the same probe file spelled two ways. `material_probe.file_value` exists
     because of it.
  2. `design_plan` vs `design` — a taste gate reached for a key the Codex schema has never had, so
     it was permanently unsatisfiable on that runtime and nobody could have filled it.
  3. `checkpoints` — 16 of 17 shared gate sections were mirrored on the Codex path and this was the
     exception: the one record that says whether a HUMAN approved anything, missing on the runtime
     most likely to compress the whole pipeline into a single pass.

Every one of those was invisible because a gate that never runs and a gate that passes look exactly
the same from outside. Adding the missing three fixed the day; this fixes the fourth.

WHAT IT CHECKS. Every `_gate_section('name')` in the shared path must be reachable in the Codex
gate, and every shared CONTRACT module the shared path imports must be imported there too. It does
NOT check that they enforce identically — a delivery gate and a pre-flight legitimately differ in
strictness — only that neither runtime is missing the concern entirely, which is the failure that
has actually happened.

A concern may be deliberately one-sided. That is a decision someone writes in ALLOWLIST with a
reason, not a gap nobody noticed.
