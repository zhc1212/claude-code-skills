"""Hold every image evidence token against something REAL — the ledger, and the built deck.

`references/image-generation.md` defines the token grammar every image row in the plan must carry
(`sourced — <origin> (<license>)`, `generated — <tool>`, `searched (Commons, Openverse), none
found → …`, …). Until now that grammar was enforced by reading: the plan said what it said, and
the two claims that actually cost something were unverifiable by construction —

  * **"I searched and found nothing."** Cheap to type, expensive to do. It is the sanctioned door
    to generating an illustration of a real place, so a run under time pressure walks through it
    without knocking. `fetch_images.py` now records every query and its outcome; this checks the
    rung against that record, and REFUSES the `none found` rung when the recorded outcome was
    `unreachable` — a blocked network is not evidence that no photo of Amsterdam exists.
  * **"CC BY, credit given."** The licence obligation is discharged by a line ON A SLIDE, and
    nothing ever looked at the slides. A deck can carry an attribution-required photo, record the
    licence dutifully in its plan, and ship with no credit anywhere — a licence violation that
    every gate in the tree currently calls clean.

What it does NOT do: judge whether a photo is the right subject or good enough. That is
`image_qc.py` plus eyes (see both files' docstrings). This one is about the RECORD.
