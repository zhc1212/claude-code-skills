"""sigs — print the exact call contract for several helpers in ONE lookup.

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured. On one 12-page build the author read helper signatures one at a time,
each read costing a full round-trip, and still shipped two call-shape errors that took three more
round-trips to correct: a run tuple passed with the font in the wrong position, and a colour passed
as a hex string where an RGBColor was required. Reading `deckkit.py` around a function answers one
question; planning a slide needs five answers at once, and every extra round-trip re-sends the whole
conversation (measured: ~302k tokens per call by mid-build).

So: name every helper the slide will use, get every signature back together, before writing code.

Covers deckkit and designed_charts. Exits 1 if any name is unknown, with near-miss suggestions —
a typo must not read as "no such helper, hand-roll it", which is the failure this guards against.

# `register_surface` is here for the same reason the other two are: this lookup is where an agent

CONTRACTS = """\
CALL-SHAPE CONTRACTS (the ones that have actually gone wrong):
  · a text RUN is (text, size, color, bold, italic[, font])  — font is the SIXTH item. Runs live in
    paragraphs: text(slide, x, y, w, h, [[run, run], [run]]) is TWO paragraphs.
  · MEASURING takes a DIFFERENT run shape than PLACING. measure_text(runs, w, size) wants a FLAT
    list of (text, bold) 2-tuples — not the paragraphs text() takes. SKILL.md tells you to use the
    pair together ("measure or anchor, never hand-pick a y"), so the mismatch is hit on the first
    honest attempt: passing text()'s paragraphs raises `not enough values to unpack (expected 2)`.
        h = dk.measure_text([(body, False)], w, 14)      # measure
        dk.text(s, x, y, w, h, [[(body, 14, dk.DEEP, False, False, dk.FONT)]])   # place
    🔴 …and the SAME LINE SPACING. `text()` takes `line_spacing=`; `measure_text` assumed its own
    default and nothing tied them together, so measuring at the default and placing at 1.16
    reserves ~4% too little. Measured: a divider derived from that return was drawn through the
    last line of the block above it, and BOTH linters passed the page — the geometry they check
    is computed from the same short number. Pass the value to both:
        h = dk.measure_text(runs, w, 12, line_spacing=1.16)                     # measure AT it
        dk.text(s, x, y, w, h, paras, line_spacing=1.16)                        # place AT it
    🔴 The measure and the place must name the SAME face. measure_text takes `font=` — pass it
    whenever you place in anything but the deck default, above all MONO. Measured: the same
    command string is 4.04in in Helvetica and 5.44in in Courier, so measuring mono text in the
    default face under-reports it by 26% and the box is then built to the wrong size, which every
    later check happily agrees with.
        h = dk.measure_text([(cmd, False)], w, 12, font=dk.MONO)                 # measure IN MONO
        dk.text(s, x, y, w, h, [[(cmd, 12, dk.DEEP, False, False, dk.MONO)]])    # place
  · colours passed to set_font / box(line=) / anything typed RGBColor must BE RGBColor, not "RRGGBB".
    box(fill=) and box(grad=) do accept a hex string. When unsure, wrap: RGBColor.from_string(h).
  · picture(slide, PATH, x, y, w, h, fit=…) takes the path SECOND — before the geometry, unlike
    every other placing helper. Passing it after w/h raises a `stat: path should be string … not
    float`, which reads as a broken file rather than a swapped argument.
  · value_fmt IS TWO DIALECTS, split by who renders the number. native_chart / native_dual_axis /
    native_donut / native_pareto hand it to POWERPOINT, so it is an EXCEL number-format code
    ('0.0%', '#,##0', '0.0"x"') — and native_chart raises a lecture if you pass '{...}'. sankey,
    iso_bars and the designed_charts recipes format in PYTHON, so there it is a format STRING
    ('{:.0f}', '{:.0%}'). Crossing them is silent on the sankey/iso side: the literal text
    '0%' is printed onto every node. Excel dialect for native_*, Python dialect for everything else.
  · ONE TYPE SIZE PER PARAGRAPH. lint_layout measures a paragraph's INK at its LARGEST run size, so
    a 38pt number inline with 10.5pt CJK is scored as multi-line 38pt text and "collides" with
    whatever sits below — while the frames themselves are provably fine. The fix is never a bigger
    gap; it is two blocks:
        y = place(x, y, [[("257万1,037", 38, …, FONT)]])          # the number
        place(x, y + 0.08, [[("人 · 在日外国劳动者", 10.5, …, EAFONT)]])   # its unit, separately
    Measured on one deck: 7 of the first 20 build-time criticals were this single mistake.
  · A COMPONENT OWNS ITS AXIS — never hand-derive one to overlay on it. dot_strip / dumbbell_board /
    timeline(spacing='value') reserve their own label gutter, so an axis_scale() you build from the
    same (x, w) does NOT land where theirs did. Measured: a 1.00 parity line computed that way was
    drawn to the RIGHT of the 1.18 dot — the chart contradicting its own numbers, and no lint can
    see it. Either set the component's `lo` to the threshold so the axis origin IS the reference
    (best — geometry becomes true by construction), or drop the overlay and say it in the caption.
  · highlight= SELECTS A SERIES; emphasize= selects a BAR. On a SINGLE-series column/bar chart
    highlight is a no-op that greys everything — which silently deletes a semantic-colour binding
    the whole page rests on. One series → emphasize=<category index>.
  · native_chart(kind="bar") plots the FIRST category at the BOTTOM. Feed the list ASCENDING for it
    to read as a descending ranking top-to-bottom. A ranking rendered upside down still lints clean.
  · source_note() anchors to the canvas floor and then LIFTS clear of whatever it finds — on a full
    page that walks it up INTO the content (measured: landed at y=3.88 on a 5.6in canvas, straight
    through a data row). On any dense page pass an explicit `y`, and reserve that strip when you
    compute the page's content bottom. Call it LAST either way.
  · A COLOUR TOKEN IS SCOPED TO ITS GROUND. A muted grey chosen for a light canvas measures ~3:1 on
    the dark bookend; a text-safe accent for the light ground measures ~2.9:1 on it. Keep a token
    per ground and resolve by ground (`mute_for(bg)`, `on(fill)`), never by name — the failure is
    invisible in the build and legible only in the render.
  · A HAND-MADE SHAPE KEEPS THE THEME SHADOW. add_shape() stamps <p:style> with the theme's soft
    drop shadow; `shadow.inherit = False` writes an empty effectLst that PowerPoint honours and
    LibreOffice IGNORES — so the render and the visual critic still see it. Pass every hand-made
    shape through deckkit._flat().
