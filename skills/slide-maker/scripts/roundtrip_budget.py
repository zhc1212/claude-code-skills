"""Measure what a deck build actually COST in round-trips, and say so out loud.

Why this exists
---------------
SKILL.md's preamble states the governing equation — *"the cost of a deck is `round-trips x
context`, not the size of what you write"* — and Step 5 restates it at the two places it binds
(the render self-check's slide reads, the fix pass's edits). All three are prose. Prose with no
gate is advisory in practice: nothing reports a run that read fourteen PNGs in fourteen messages,
because the deck still builds, every lint still passes, and the critic still consents. The bill
arrives as wall-clock the user notices and cannot attribute.

So this script computes the number from the session transcript rather than asking anyone to
remember it, and the Step-6 hand-off `cost:` line carries the measured value. It is a REPORTER,
not a blocker: it never fails a build. A heuristic that halts a finished deck would be worse than
the problem, and the point is attribution, not enforcement.

What it measures
----------------
  round-trips     assistant turns that issued >=1 tool call. This is the term that multiplies by
                  context, so it is the headline number.
  batching ratio  tool calls / round-trip. 1.00 means every call went in its own message; the
                  skill's own measured build averaged exactly 1.00 and its first fifteen calls
                  were unrelated fact-gathering that could have been three.
  image batching  the largest number of image reads issued in a single message, against the deck's
                  slide count — the render self-check is meant to read them all at once.
  context         median tokens re-sent per turn. Multiply by round-trips for the real bill.

Usage
-----
  python3 scripts/roundtrip_budget.py                       # newest transcript touching cwd
  python3 scripts/roundtrip_budget.py --transcript X.jsonl  # an explicit one
  python3 scripts/roundtrip_budget.py --slides 14 --json    # machine-readable, for the cost: line

Exit status is 0 unless the transcript could not be read at all (2) — over-budget is reported in
the text, never in the exit code.
