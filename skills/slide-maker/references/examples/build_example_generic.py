"""Generic worked example — a short, brand-free deck built FROM SCRATCH (no template),
showing BOTH the deckkit helpers and the per-slide-function SCAFFOLD every single-author
build should copy: a STYLE block at the top → one function per slide whose DOCSTRING is
that slide's design-plan row + motion-manifest line → an ordered SLIDES registry →
main() builds ALL slides, runs the build-time geometry gate, and saves.

Why the scaffold: each docstring carries `role=… | form=… | build:…/static:… |
takeaway='…'`, so PRE-FLIGHT #3 becomes a mechanical diff (design-plan rows vs these
docstrings) plus a spot-check that each `build:` docstring has matching Build.step calls
in its function body — and the motion manifest the Step-5 critic reads IS these
docstrings, not a comment block that drifts.

🔴 TWO RULES THIS FILE DEMONSTRATES RATHER THAN STATES, because a scaffold teaches by example
and this one used to teach the opposite of both:

  1. NEVER hand-pick a y for a block that can grow. Measure it (`measure_bullets`/`measure_callout`
     /`measure_text`) or anchor it (`vstack(..., bottom=)`, `content_band()`, `bottom_callout()`).
     Measured on a real 14-page build: the author hand-computed nearly every y, spent many rounds
     moving coordinates by 0.02in, and only reached for `vstack` after pages had already started
     overlapping — at which point its first error, "blocks need 3.68in but the band is only
     2.88in", was the single most useful sentence of the build. It says the page is OVER-FULL,
     which no amount of nudging can fix. That error arriving on round one instead of round twelve
     is the whole difference.

  2. TAG the deck's signature device. `register_mark()` draws the common register shapes correct
     by construction and tags them (reach past `arcs`/`rule`/`grid` for one of the subject-world
     kinds — `seal`, `stitch`, `trace`, `contour`, `caliper`, `hatch` — or the deck's corner will
     look like every other deck's); `motif_page()` builds the LOUD page whose geometry IS the
     device, with `legend=` drawing the key that satisfies the stranger test; anything you draw
     yourself gets `tag_motif(shape, loud=…)`.
     Untagged, a motif is invisible to `TEXT_OVER_MOTIF` and to the <=3-loud-appearance budget —
     measured on that same build, 383 shapes carried ZERO tags, so the check written for its own
     cover defect reported nothing on it.

If the user has a template, build on it instead (deckkit.open_template + the template's
profile in the active template registry). This file is just a how-to for the kit.

Run:  python build_example_generic.py   →  <tempdir>/slide_maker_demo.pptx
Then: bash ../../scripts/render_deck.sh <that path>   (or, on native Windows,
      python ..\\..\\scripts\\render_deck.py <that path>)  and inspect the PNGs.
