# Hand-off & iterating after delivery — don't lose the user's edits

🔴 **You no longer have to REMEMBER to check whether the user hand-edited the deck.** `declare_delivery`
records the sha256 of what the build script saved, and `render_deck.py --gate-check` reports
`EDITED SINCE BUILD` when the file on disk no longer matches it. Measured, and the reason this exists:
a user edited a delivered deck in PowerPoint and saved it beside the built one — it was invisible to
every tool in the repo, and was noticed only because the folder had moved. The reconcile procedure
below was documented the whole time and nothing ever said it was needed.
🔴 **It reports, and never blocks.** Hand-editing a delivered deck is normal, and the right response
depends on intent — what was missing was any way to KNOW. Its honest limit: it tells you at the gate,
not before a rebuild overwrites, so run `--gate-check` before you regenerate a deck you have handed
over.


The deck doesn't stop mattering once it's saved. Two things go wrong *after* delivery,
and both are avoidable:
1. The user doesn't realize the deck is fully editable (or is afraid to touch it).
2. The user hand-edits the deck, then asks for one more change — and a naive rebuild
   **overwrites their edits**, because the build script regenerates the file from
   scratch and the two never merged. (This has happened to a real user; it is the most
   damaging post-delivery failure.)

## Two cheap disciplines worth keeping
- **Versioned critic rounds:** keep each critic-round build as `deck_v<N>.pptx` (+ its renders)
  instead of overwriting in place; when applying round-N fixes, diff the new renders against
  round N-1 for the slides you did NOT touch — a "fix" that regresses a previously-approved slide
  is the loop's classic own-goal, and the diff catches it deterministically.
- **Prewire note (decide-goal decks):** the hand-off note may include one line — "this deck asks
  for a decision: consider walking the key approver(s) through the storyline 1:1 before the
  meeting, so the meeting confirms rather than debates" (the consulting prewire norm; out of
  scope for the builder, high value for the presenter).

## Iterating fast after delivery
Post-delivery tweaks are conversational — "make slide 7 a chart", "shrink that title" — and each
round costs a build plus a render, both a few seconds. So for every round after the first, re-render
with **`--fast`**: it diffs a per-slide
fingerprint against the previous run and re-renders only what changed, subsetting the pptx to those
slides. Measured on an 18-slide deck: full ~2.8s → **~2.3s** for a one-slide edit, and a no-op round
**0.07s**. Read those two savings differently. The no-op round is the enormous one (~40×) because it
never starts LibreOffice at all. A one-slide round still starts it once, and that start is a fixed
~2.5s floor that dwarfs the page work — so expect roughly a fifth off, not a multiple, and never
skip a re-render on the theory that it is expensive.
The PNGs it writes are byte-identical to a full render, so the lint and the critic are unaffected.
`--fast` and `--deliverables` are mutually exclusive (a subset render has no whole-deck PDF): use
`--fast` for the iteration rounds, then one plain `--deliverables` run for the hand-off.
**`--slides N[,M]`** is the third member of the family: it renders exactly the pages you name, for
when you already KNOW what changed (the Step-4 signature proof, or "re-render just page 7"). 🔴 **It
is not a speed flag** — measured on the same deck, one page costs ~2.9s against ~2.8s for all
eighteen, because both pay the one fixed LibreOffice start. Reach for it when you want exactly those
PNGs (a single page to post, a page whose neighbours you must not overwrite), never to save time.
Same
exclusivity as `--fast` — not with `--deliverables`, and not with `--fast` itself, which chooses the
set for you. It deliberately writes NO cache: it rendered some pages, so recording fingerprints for
all of them would let the next `--fast` call stale PNGs current. That means the run AFTER a
`--slides` run does a full render — correct, and the reason is printed.
**`--fast`** falls back to a full render, with the reason printed, whenever the page mapping could
be wrong (slide count changed, every slide changed, auto slide-number fields, no cache) — a slow
render is an acceptable outcome; a stale PNG that a critic then signs off on is not. **`--slides`
does NOT fall back**: you named the pages, so a deck whose mapping is uncertain is an error, not a
silent widening — it exits 1 and tells you to render the whole deck.

## What the deliverable folder contains

🔴 **`<deck>-notes.pdf` — the speaker handout** — is written by `--deliverables` whenever the deck
has notes on any slide: one page per slide, the slide above its own notes. It is what a presenter
rehearses from and what gets handed out afterwards, and it did not exist while this skill required
speaker notes and read them to estimate the talk's length. The deck PDF beside it is re-exported at hand-off
through LibreOffice's **PDF/UA** filter, so the alt text the a11y gate demanded is actually in the
file a reader receives — the plain export carried none. (Re-exported, not exported once: the
render's own PDF feeds the PNG rasterization, and putting the filter on that path changed a pixel
check's verdict on a different LibreOffice.)

The deck + `render/` PNGs, the build script (source of truth), the speaker-notes source,
`assets/` (incl. `sourced/credits.txt` when sourced photos exist),
and the final lint/stats snapshot — a tidy, buildable bundle.
**`<deck>.pdf` and `viewer.html` are RESERVED deliverables, not part of the working folder:** they
would go stale on every rebuild and after any hand-edit, so they are generated on request at
hand-off — `render_deck … --deliverables` — once the user says the deck is final, and re-generated
after any later change so the pair never lags the `.pptx`. The content/design PLANS are **not**
files here: they are presented directly in chat as compact tables at the two checkpoints (that
conversation is the record); write plan `.md` files only if the user explicitly asks.

## The core model: the script is the source of truth
A per-deck build (`build_<deck>.py`) **regenerates** the entire `.pptx` every run. So:
- The **script** is the source of truth; the **`.pptx` is a build artifact**.
- Keep the script in the deck folder next to the `.pptx` (step 3) so it travels with the
  deck and any iteration is reproducible.
- The moment the user hand-edits the `.pptx`, there are **two diverging sources of
  truth** (their edited file, your script) that do not auto-merge. From then on you must
  *reconcile*, never blindly regenerate.

## What to tell the user at hand-off (step 6)
Say it plainly, in one or two lines:
- **It's fully editable.** The `.pptx` is native — real text frames, shapes, and images,
  not a flattened picture. They can edit anything in PowerPoint/Keynote and save; nothing
  is locked or rasterized.
- **Two non-conflicting lanes for changes** (so a rebuild never eats their work):
  1. **Take it from here in PowerPoint.** They keep editing the file themselves; you
     won't re-run the build over it (if they later want *your* help, you work on a copy
     or reconcile first — see below).
  2. **Tell you the changes.** You edit the **build script** and rebuild — reproducible,
     and it survives every future iteration.
- **Caveats worth a sentence:** fonts substitute if the recipient's machine lacks them
  (text may reflow — note any CJK/brand-font dependency from `multilingual.md`); the
  layout is absolutely positioned, so heavily expanding a text box won't auto-reflow its
  neighbours (normal PowerPoint behaviour); and credit portability — CC BY/BY-SA credits live
  on-slide / on the sources page + `credits.txt`, so keep them if the images are reused.
- **PDF on request, not by default.** `render_deck` keeps the pptx→PDF conversion as a render
  intermediate inside `render/` and does **not** park a `<deck>.pdf` beside the `.pptx` unless you
  pass `--deliverables`. So don't tell the user a PDF is sitting next to the deck — offer it, and
  produce it once they confirm the deck is final (see the reserved-deliverables note above). Round
  PDFs need no cleanup: they never leave the render dir, which is rewritten each full render.

## Iterating after delivery — the safety rule
🔴 **MUST — before any post-delivery rebuild, determine whether the user has hand-edited the
file since your last build** — ask them, or compare the `.pptx` mtime to when you last wrote
it. This fires in a *later session* where no pipeline gate runs and the reflex path (just
rebuild) is the destructive one — treat it as a hard stop, not a courtesy. **Gate artifact
(required, per the enforcement invariant):** record one literal line in the round's response
BEFORE rebuilding — `hand-edit check: asked|mtime-compared — clean|reconciled` — a post-delivery
rebuild with no such line means the check didn't run. (The Step-6 note spec in SKILL.md is the one
authoritative hand-off checklist — conditional items like the `provenance:` line, click order, and
image credits live there; this file adds the iterate-safely mechanics only.)

- **They have NOT hand-edited** → safe path: edit the **build script**, rebuild, re-render,
  re-run the critic. This is the normal iteration loop.
- **They HAVE hand-edited** → **do not regenerate over their file.** Reconcile instead:
  - *Preferred:* recover their changes with `python3 scripts/extract_deck.py
    <their_deck.pptx>` (their current text, tables, **chart data, speaker notes** and figures),
    fold those edits back into the build script so the script matches reality, *then* make the new
    change and rebuild. Now the script is the source of truth again.
    **Check the `⚠ UNEXTRACTED` lines before you rebuild.** This step ends by declaring the build
    script canonical, so anything the extractor missed is not merely absent from a report — it is
    deleted from the user's deck by the very procedure that exists to protect it. (Speaker notes and
    native charts were both silently dropped here until they were fixed: a user who hand-added a
    results chart and rewrote three slides' narration got a `content.md` with neither, and the
    procedure then called the script the source of truth.)
  - *Or, for a small tweak:* open **their** edited file and make the change in place
    (python-pptx or by hand), leaving the rest untouched — and don't run the generator.
  - Either way, **confirm which version is canonical before overwriting anything you
    didn't just create** (the general "look before you clobber" rule). If you keep a
    rebuild aside, name it clearly (e.g. `_rebuilt_backup.pptx`) rather than replacing
    their file.
- **Re-verify the right file.** If they hand-edited, render *their* file
  (`render_deck.sh their_deck.pptx`) to re-check layout — not a fresh build.

## Move the dial, don't flip it — correcting on design feedback
Design feedback names a **dimension**, not a pole — treat it as "move this dial a step,"
never "jump to the opposite extreme." Overshooting trades one complaint for its mirror
image and costs another full round: *muted → rainbow chrome on every slide* is as wrong
as the muted deck was; *dense → stripped bare* and *static → everything animated* are the
same failure on other dials. So when the user critiques a dimension:
1. **Locate WHERE it actually failed** — almost always the *content layer*, not the
   scaffolding. "More colour / more contrast" means colour on the elements that carry
   meaning (data, diagram nodes, icons, hero numbers); it is **not** a licence to paint
   the chrome (title furniture, spines, rules, footers stay quiet — the chrome budget in
   `agents/slide-design.md` §1).
2. **Move that one dial a deliberate step** and re-render; if the user says "further,"
   take another step — two cheap rounds beat one overshoot.
3. **Hold every dimension they did NOT criticise stable**, so they can judge the fix in
   isolation rather than re-reviewing the whole design.
4. **Record WHY the round happened** — the round record gains one **`user-dials:`** line per
   criticised dimension: `dimension → direction, layer — "verbatim user words"` (e.g.
   `colour: +vivid, content layer — "太素了"`). Zero cost when no iteration happens — and it is
   the observation stream the Step-6 taste write-back promotes from (below), so a preference
   the user voiced twice never has to be re-taught at the cost of a render-review round.
The critic's design lens applies the matching check on **any round after the first —
critic-fix rounds exactly like user-feedback rounds** (**pendulum
overshoot**, `review-rubrics.md` §9) — a fix that swung to the opposite extreme is a
finding, not a fix, whoever named the dial; when a `user-dials:` line exists for the round,
cite it as the check's evidence — the user's own words fix which dial moved and how far.

## The taste write-back (step 6 close) — durable dials only
The `user-dials:` ledger above is the per-deck observation stream; **`taste.md` at the
registry root** (resolve it with `python3 scripts/registry.py` — `~/.claude/slide-templates/` ·
`~/.codex/slide-templates/` · host-neutral `~/.slide-maker/slide-templates/`) is the durable
store; the **Step-6 close is the only bridge** — full schema + protocol in
`references/user-taste.md`. Three named actions (the Step-6 close checklist in SKILL.md is
the gate — a write not on it didn't happen):
1. **Append ONE look-history line** for the delivered deck (`date | deck | preset/look |
   canvas value | signature motif`, pruned to the 10 most recent) — next deck's freshness
   rule varies against it.
2. **Promote a dial ONLY on the recurrence gate (🔴 MUST):** the user's own words mark it
   standing ("always", "一直", "in general", "for all my decks"), or the same
   dimension+direction appears in the round records of **≥2 distinct decks** — once is a
   deck-scoped correction, twice is a preference. Every DIALS row carries its verbatim quote
   + deck + date (an unevidenced dial is an invention); later conflicting feedback **UPDATES
   the row — move the dial** — never appends a contradiction (two rows arguing about one
   dimension is exactly the diverging-sources-of-truth failure this file exists to prevent).
3. **Say it, don't hide it** — every write gets one hand-off FYI line (*"recorded to your
   taste profile: <X> — say the word and I'll drop it"*); the file is the user's own, so the
   veto is one edit.
A brand-new user (no `taste.md`) gets no writes until the first durable signal — never
manufacture a profile. The **save-this-look offer** (persist a freshly-designed look to the
registry, Notes distilled from the final critic `strengths`) rides the same hand-off note —
opt-in on an explicit yes only; see `references/user-taste.md` §"Consented-look mining".

## Why this matters
A deck is a living document the user will rehearse with and keep tweaking. The skill
earns trust by making the deck genuinely theirs to own — editable, reproducible, and
safe to iterate — not a fragile binary that a "quick fix" silently resets. Treat their
manual edits as first-class content, exactly like their source material.
