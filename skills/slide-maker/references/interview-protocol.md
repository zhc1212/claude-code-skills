# Interview protocol

## Step 0 — personalization, Q1 (template), Q2 (purpose/venue), Q3 (source material)

🔴 **Five questions, a four-slot widget, and the axis that disappears.** A choice UI (Claude Code's
`AskUserQuestion`) takes FOUR questions per call; this interview has FIVE lines. "Ask them in one
batched call" therefore truncates the last one silently — and that is the line LANGUAGE lives on.
Measured: a real deck was built in this repo's own session with language never asked, and the gates
record carried `delivery`, `builds` and `content.slides` (the three axes something downstream
demanded) and no answer for language, density, length or goal. Send **two calls**. Then RECORD the
four: `interview.language / .density / .length / .goal`, required by both gates from one shared list
(`deck_gates.INTERVIEW_AXES`) and scaffolded by `deck_gates.py --init`. An axis with no artifact
demanding it is an axis that goes unasked — this file said exactly that about deck length, in prose,
and the failure moved one axis over.

**Personalize options only from THIS user's own footprint — never a hardcoded or guessed
domain — and roll past work up into ONE option, drilling in only on pick (Q1's two-stage
pattern), so personalization never crowds out the general choices.** Any *suggestions* you pre-fill into a question — candidate topics, example
subjects, registered templates — must come from what this user has actually given you:
materials they provided (now or in a past session) or their saved registry / profile /
memory. 🔴 **Resolve the registry root by RUNNING `python3 scripts/registry.py`, not from
memory** — one call prints every existing root, the templates registered across them, and the
write target. `~/.claude/slide-templates/` and `~/.codex/slide-templates/` keep priority;
anything else (Kimi · Gemini · Cursor · Coze · an API caller) falls back to the host-neutral
`~/.slide-maker/slide-templates/`, which exists because a hardcoded two-host list left every
other runtime with no root at all — and therefore, silently, with no saved templates to offer
at Q1(a) and no taste profile. **Read `taste.md` at that
same registry root in the same pass** — the user's portable taste profile (schema +
read/write protocol: `references/user-taste.md`): its DIALS/NO-GOs seed *delegated* picks
under an auto directive, and its LOOK HISTORY supplies the substance of the two-stage
rolled-up history options below — never new option shapes, never an auto-lock. **Precedence
(🔴 MUST): current request > this interview's answers > `taste.md`** — the profile seeds
defaults and options only and never overrides an explicit answer or checkpoint decision,
because a memory that outranks the user's live words is a cage *(gate: the Design plan's
required `taste profile:` line records what was applied, so an override is visible)*. A
missing or empty `taste.md` is **silently skipped**. A **brand-new user has no footprint**, so do NOT seed a specific domain (e.g.
don't offer "MRI reconstruction" or any field as a topic just because some *past* deck
used it) or a prior user's branding — ask the subject **openly** (a genuinely open-ended
topic is the one place free text beats options) and offer only the generic template/look
choices: "provide a template", "design a clean one", and, when a more vivid custom identity
would fit, "generate a template with an image tool". Personalizing from a *returning* user's
own materials is good and encouraged; assuming a domain for someone who gave you nothing is
the failure to avoid.
**The TWO-STAGE rule governs past-work personalization in EVERY question, not just templates:**
whatever the question, history enters as **ONE rolled-up option beside the always-present general
choices**, and the specific past items are listed only in a follow-up if the user picks it.
Instances — **Q1 template:** "one of your saved templates (N)" (worked mechanics in Q1 below) ·
**topic/subject:** a returning user with known past projects gets ONE "continue one of my previous
topics" option beside the open free-text ask — never their domains enumerated as competing options ·
**Q4 style:** ONE "like one of my previous decks" option beside the generic density/tone choices,
expanding to named past looks on pick — the named looks come from `taste.md`'s LOOK HISTORY
(`— praised` lines first) plus the registered templates (`references/user-taste.md`) · same shape
for any other history (past purposes, prior venues). Marking a *general* option "(Recommended)" is fine and unaffected — the rule bounds how
PAST ITEMS enter, so they never crowd generic paths out of a bounded-option UI.

**🔴 Emit a CAPABILITY LEDGER before the first question — four lines, from what you can observe
about THIS host.** The skill is written for a host with a structured-choice UI, subagent dispatch,
image input and web access; it runs on hosts with none of them. The danger is not that a weaker
host produces a worse deck — it is that it produces a worse deck **while every report reads
identically**, because the stages that degrade are the ones that self-certify. Measured: a run that
read 3 of 10 reference files shipped zero icons and a raw format string on a slide, and every
automated gate passed.

    capability ledger
      choice UI    : yes | no  → no = ask the four questions as plain text, never fake a form
      subagents    : yes | no  → no = the planner/art-director/critic run inline; see below
      image input  : yes | no  → no = the critic's DESIGN lens cannot see the render
      web access   : yes | no  → no = no-web fallback (mark falsifiable claims open, ask the user)

Carry it to the hand-off verbatim, beside `review:` and `cost:`. 🔴 **Where a capability is absent,
say what was LOST, not that an equivalent ran** — `design lens: DEGRADED (no image input — judged
from lint_deck --json structure, not from pixels)` is honest; silence is the failure this ledger
exists to prevent. Two specific degradations must never be described as equivalent:
- **No subagent dispatch.** "Run the same brief inline" preserves the WORDS and loses the property
  that made the split worth having — a critic in the author's own context is the author grading
  themselves, which is exactly what `.deck-gates.json` exists to make visible. Run it as a
  deliberately fresh pass (state the brief, judge only the render and the lint JSON, do not consult
  your build reasoning), and record `critic: inline (no dispatch on this host — not independent)`.
- **No image input.** The design lens and the render self-check are both pixel work. Substitute the
  structured surrogate (`lint_deck --json`: per-slide load, ink%, max pt, shape counts, contrast
  findings) and **say it is a surrogate** — it cannot see crop, balance, a figure smothering text,
  or anything in the paint-order blind list.

**Scale the interview to the ask:** a full deck needs
all four; a genuinely tiny ask (a single slide, a quick infographic) still needs purpose
and content confirmed, but you may collapse template/style to a sensible default *stated
in one line* ("I'll do a clean minimal look — say if you have a template") rather than a
full prompt. Scaling ≠ skipping — never infer purpose or content. Some answers trigger a quick follow-up *after* the
batch: *a conference talk* → ask which venue, then research it; *a new template* → they
hand over the file; *"design a clean one" (no template)* → run the **direction gate**
(DEFAULT on this branch — see Q1's design-one branch for the named skip carves; a Q4 Mode-A
mimic example decides the look and skips it) — show **4** rendered style directions to pick
from before the full build (>=1 BESPOKE register invented for the topic + best-fit REAL-DNA
presets + 1 pure colour-scheme direction —
see Q1(c)); *"generate a template with an image tool"* → run the mini-interview + generation
+ feedback loop in `references/generated-template.md` (its style gate shows **3** best-fit
image-backed styles), then **skip the direction gate** (the look is already decided).
**The count rule, by branch: no image tool → 4 offered; with image tool → 3 offered.** The
four template choices:

1. **Template / brand.** First **check this user's registered templates** — run
   `python3 scripts/registry.py`, which prints the count and the names across every root that
   exists on THIS runtime (Claude/Codex roots first, host-neutral `~/.slide-maker/slide-templates/`
   otherwise). Each subfolder is one template they've used before, with a `profile.md`. Reading
   the number off the tool rather than guessing it is what makes option (a)'s "N registered"
   true on a runtime this file never enumerated.
   **⚠️ WHENEVER the template question is asked, it MUST present ALL FOUR standard choices — do not
   silently drop one (especially the image-tool option, which is easy to forget). The question itself
   may be skipped only per the named carves: the current request already answers Q1, or the tiny-ask
   scale-down (default stated in one line) — and on the redesign path R0's keep/redesign answer
   REPLACES this question (on "redesign the look" ask it as the follow-up — see
   `references/redesign-existing-deck.md`):**
   **(a)** *"one of your saved templates (N registered)"* — the registry **rolled up as ONE option**
   · **(b)** *"a new template (I'll provide one)"* · **(c)** *"design a clean one"* · **(d)**
   *"generate a template with an image tool"* (a bespoke generated visual identity).
   **🔴 Before offering (d), PROBE that a free image path exists** — inside Codex the native imagegen
   tool counts; anywhere else (Claude Code included) run `command -v codex`. This costs one shell call
   and prevents the one dead end in this question: a user picks (d), the whole look is planned around
   generated imagery, and only at generation time does it emerge that nothing can generate. If no free
   path is present, still offer (d) but name its one-time prerequisite in the option itself —
   *"generate a template with an image tool (needs `codex login` once — free on your subscription)"* —
   so the setup cost is visible **before** the choice, not after. Never silently substitute a paid
   path for the missing free one; see the billing gate in `references/image-generation.md`.
   **Past work rolls up; general choices always stay.** Never enumerate the saved templates in the
   first question — a returning user's registry (which can hold many) would crowd the general
   choices out of a bounded-option UI, and the generic paths must stay visible on every deck. If the
   user picks (a), ask a quick FOLLOW-UP listing the registered templates by name (+ a one-clause
   hint each from `profile.md`) — with many, the few most recently used / best-fit first plus "show
   the rest". Carve: exactly ONE registered template may be inlined directly in place of the
   rolled-up option (no follow-up needed); an empty registry drops (a) entirely (brand-new user).
   (This instantiates the two-stage personalization rule above — the same shape applies to topic,
   style, and every other history-seeded question.) Then:
   - *A registered template* → build on it using its saved `profile.md` (step 3).
   - *A new template* → they give a `.pptx`/brand; build on it, AND after profiling it
     (step 3) **save a new subfolder to the active template registry** (its
     `profile.md`) so it becomes a remembered choice next time. The registry **grows
     through conversation.**
   - *Design a clean one* → build from preferences (brand colour/logo? formality?),
     and **shape the look to the chosen purpose** (step 3 / `references/design-by-purpose.md`)
     rather than always shipping the same default blue — a defense, an exec readout,
     and a lecture should not look alike.
     **Because the look is entirely yours to invent here, the direction gate RUNS BY
     DEFAULT on this branch — a 🔴 checkpoint-grade step, not an optional offer.**
     🔴 **Post it in the SAME turn that dispatches the Step-1 content planner, and collect the pick
     at the CONTENT checkpoint** — do not stand still waiting for it. The directions page is
     provably content-free (`archetypes_html.py` renders fixed sample copy; `build_directions_html`
     takes only `deck_title`), so the planner consumes nothing the user is about to choose, and the
     look is not consumed until Step 2 builds `style.py`. Two things the user does in parallel
     therefore cost one wait instead of two. **What must NOT change: the gate is still a gate.** The
     design checkpoint still cannot be posted without its `direction gate:` line, and that line now
     carries the user's verbatim paste-back words (`references/checkpoint-convention.md`) precisely
     because a step that no longer blocks is the kind that quietly collapses into the checkpoint
     after it. If the pick has not arrived by the time Step 2 needs it, **stop there and wait** —
     overlapping the wait is allowed, proceeding without the answer is not. This is
     the one branch where preference, not just quality, is unresolved; history shows an
     "offer" gets skipped under momentum (a whole deck shipped without the user ever seeing
     a choice of looks), so the gate is the default and skipping is the exception. Named
     carves (skip ONLY when one applies, and say so in one clause at the design checkpoint):
     the user explicitly says "just design one and go / 你定"; a Q4 Mode-A mimic example
     decides the look; the deck reuses a registered template; or a tiny-ask (1–2 slide)
     edit. Under a full per-deck AUTO WAIVER, still GENERATE the four directions, auto-pick
     the best fit, and post the rendered images + pick as the FYI (mirror of the Q1(d)
     image-tool hero checkpoint) — the waiver removes the stop, never the artifact.
     - *Running the gate* → run **Gate A** of `references/collaborative-mode.md`. **The directions
       are REAL STYLES — a named preset OR a bespoke register with its own motif — never three shades
       of one palette.** ("Synthesised" is not the enemy; a *motif-less colourway* is. A bespoke
       register you invent for this content is a real style and a first-class peer of a preset — often
       the more daring answer, see the launchpad note below.) Fill the preset slots with the **best-fit design languages** for
       THIS topic/audience — presets from the 18-preset library (read each preset's `when` field in
       `scripts/presets.py` / `references/design-gallery.md`; e.g. a technical talk → blueprint /
       dark_tech / swiss, a culture deck → memphis / risograph / editorial_paper, a Chinese-heritage
       deck → ink_wash / eastern_traditional / museum_memorial), then
       **`archetypes_html.preset_directions([names])`** turns them into direction tokens that carry
       each preset's real **DNA** (its signature motif — Swiss's ghost numeral, Memphis's scattered
       shapes, blueprint's schematic grid, ink_wash's seal chop), rendered by
       `scripts/archetypes_html.py` into **ONE self-contained HTML page** showing them in the
       **same** representative slides (cover / points+callout / diagram / data). This is the fix for
       "the 3 options were just different colours": a preset is a whole visual language, and the
       preview now SHOWS it — **and the DNA runs through every preview slide, not just the cover**
       (the ambient register signature; `_dna_ambient`), so the user sees a style that carries the
       whole deck.
       - 🔴 **On this no-image-tool branch, offer FOUR rendered directions, not three:** the 3
         directions A/B/C — **at least one of them a BESPOKE register invented for this topic, the
         rest best-fit DNA presets** — **plus a 4th "colour-scheme" direction (D)** — one tasteful
         palette+type combination for THIS topic with **no motif**, the classic clean look (this is
         itself a legitimate style; a user asked for it to stay on the menu). Build all four in one
         call: `preset_directions(["p1","p2","p3", {colour_token}])` — a **dict** is passed through
         verbatim as a no-`dna` colour direction (name it e.g. *"Signal — pure palette + type"*).
         The HTML labels A–D as the four options and **E — describe your own** as the fifth slot (the
         own-letter is dynamic, so no collision). *(With an image tool it's the OTHER branch — Q1(d)'s
         style gate — which stays at 3.)*
       - 🔴 **AT LEAST ONE of the offered directions MUST be a bespoke register invented for THIS
         topic — not a preset.** Presets are the FLOOR you beat, not the menu you satisfy. A bespoke
         direction is a dict in the `preset_directions` list carrying its OWN `cover_motif` +
         `ambient_motif`, so it renders real DNA rather than a motif-less colourway; with a named
         motif + palette + type + its own guard + item-(q) all-pages carry it is a first-class peer
         of any preset, and usually the bolder pick. Weigh it on every design-clean deck — it is a
         requirement, not a fallback for "a topic no preset fits". The library raises the floor;
         your job is still to beat it.
         **Why this became a MUST rather than a preference:** the previous wording ("PREFER a bespoke
         register when the content has one") is exactly the shape of rule this skill keeps proving
         gets skipped — it is advisory, nothing reports its absence, and the cheapest path is always
         three preset names. **Derive the bespoke register from what the content already IS**, not
         from a style vocabulary: ask what world this material lives in (its objects, its signage,
         its instruments, its documents) and build the motif out of that. Where the subject has a
         real-world visual system of its own, borrowing THAT system is almost always stronger than
         any preset — it makes the colour, the marker and the line carry meaning instead of taste.
         *(Measured: on a deck about routes into a country's labour market, a bespoke transit-signage
         register — line colour = visa route, numbered roundel = step, buffer stop = dead end — beat
         all three best-fit presets, and then supplied the deck's signature move for free, because
         the motif was load-bearing rather than decorative.)*
       - 🔴 **The verdict now LANDS IN `.deck-gates.json` and is RE-SCORED at hand-off**, the way
         the arc competition is: record `design_plan.direction_gate = {"candidates": "directions.json",
         "picked": "<the chosen one>"}`, or the named carve `"n/a — <locked template | mimic |
         user supplied the look | tiny ask>"`. `render_deck.py --gate-check` runs
         `directions_diversity.check()` over the candidates itself. Measured on a real build: the
         script reports `TOO SIMILAR Brutalist vs Swiss (palette 37.9)` — which the author caught
         by eye — AND `NO BESPOKE DIRECTION`, which the author did NOT catch: the "bespoke"
         candidate carried colours, a cover and a skeleton but no `cover_motif`, so the user chose
         from three presets and a colourway. Neither finding reached the design checkpoint, because
         nothing required the script to be run.
       - 🔴 **The mechanical check enforces it — on BOTH failure directions:** `directions_diversity.py`
         fails a set in which **no** direction carries `cover_motif`/`ambient_motif` (no bespoke), AND
         a set carrying **more than one motif-less colourway** (`colourway_excess` — the "just different
         colours" set). The branch is **3 real styles (best-fit DNA presets and/or a bespoke register,
         TOPIC-ADAPTED) + 1 colour-scheme option**, so a preset-only set is the catalogue *and* a set of
         bare colourways is under-designed — both exit 2, both with the same named-`direction gate:`
         escape. Build the styled slots with `preset_directions([names])` (each stamps a real `dna`) or a
         bespoke dict; a hand-written colour dict with neither `dna` nor a motif counts as a plain
         colourway, and only ONE is allowed. *(This closed a measured hole: a `3 plain colourways + 1
         bespoke` set passed every pairwise divergence test and the bespoke gate, yet was exactly the
         mediocre "the options were just different colours" set the whole preset-driven gate exists to
         prevent. The Codex delivery gate loads the SAME checker, so both paths reject it identically.)*
         **The requirement is to OFFER one, never that it must win** — the user may well pick a
         preset, and that is a real choice made against a real alternative rather than a default.
         **Escape, same shape as the divergence check's:** if you genuinely cannot invent one, keep
         the set and record why on the `direction gate:` line (e.g. `no bespoke — brand mandates
         palette, type AND grid; variance had nowhere left to live`). A recorded reason is a decision
         someone made; a silently preset-only set is the default this exists to interrupt. Note that
         a brand lock is rarely a real escape: a motif, a composition envelope and an interior
         register signature are all still yours even when the palette and type are not.
       - **This gate also fires on the lighter case-(b) offer** (unsure-on-style / brand-defining,
         2–3 directions) because it is the same machinery — which is the right default, since those
         are exactly the decks where an invented register pays most.
       - 🔴 **DIVERGENCE IS A PAIRWISE RULE, NOT AN EXHORTATION: any two directions must differ on
         ≥2 of four axes — {palette mood · type attitude · density/scale · COMPOSITION ENVELOPE}.**
         "Distinct light/dark, warm/cool, serif/sans" describes *knobs*; a dark version and a light
         version of one layout are two coats on one design. The composition axis is the token set's
         `cover` (`centred | low-left | split-vertical | full-bleed-type`) and `skeleton`
         (`statement | split | island | band | rail`) — **where the ink sits**, which is what a
         viewer reads first with the page squinted. *(Measured motivation: a real delivered deck had
         8/12 pages on one composition signature and 55/66 page pairs under the "same shape" line —
         while its FORMS varied correctly. Composition was never chosen, only defaulted.)*
       - **LOCK-AND-REDIRECT.** When the user or a brand fixes an axis (a mandated accent, "match our
         corporate look", a Q4 mimic), that axis LEAVES the divergence set and the ≥2 rule re-applies
         to the ones that remain. A constraint relocates variance; it never licenses convergence.
       - 🔴 **Run the mechanical check before you post the link:**
         `python3 scripts/directions_diversity.py directions.json`. It scores four axes — **palette
         mood** (a light/dark flip counts as a palette divergence, so mode is folded in) · **type
         pairing** · **density** · **composition** — and flags any pair matching on ≥3 of the 4. It ALSO
         fails a set with no bespoke direction (above). **Exit 2 is not an auto-kill, and it now
         carries two distinct meanings — read the output, do not infer from the code**: a flagged
         PAIR (rediverge it, or keep it and record the reason on the `direction gate:` line —
         "brand-locked accent — divergence moved to composition + type") and/or NO BESPOKE
         direction (invent one, or record why you could not). `--json` reports them separately as
         `flagged` and `no_bespoke`.
         The check exists because the agent that writes the directions is the same agent that
         judges whether they differ; only an outside measurement catches several skins of one idea. **Hand the user the single `file://…
       directions.html` link** to open in a browser, review side-by-side, and pick from — no
       local pptx samples. Collect the pick + knobs. Present the pick as **A / B / C / D (the four
       rendered directions) plus a final "E — describe your own" option**: if the user picks E, they
       *type the look they have in mind* (a reference, a brand, a mood, a constraint) and you
       **synthesize a new direction from that description** — regenerate the HTML link and show it
       alongside (iterate until they consent), rather than forcing one of your four guesses. The four
       are only your opening proposals; the author's own intention always outranks them. **The pick
       fixes the REGISTER (palette · type · composition · the interior register signature), NOT the
       daring — it is a launchpad, not a finished design.** "Picked a preset → rendered the preset" does
       not discharge the design step: the boldness/signature-move gate still runs in full and the deck
       still owes one `signature move` this preset would not have made (`agents/slide-design.md` §1,
       self-verify (h)/(k); the critic's distinctiveness axis flags a faithful-preset-with-no-bespoke-move
       as template-with-extra-steps). On the
       pick, the chosen token-set becomes the deck's `style.py` **including its composition — the
       `cover` token is BUILT as the cover's actual layout, and the `skeleton` token becomes the
       rhythm map's plurality skeleton (`collaborative-mode.md` Gate A step 7; a style.py that
       keeps the hexes and drops the composition has discarded half the pick)** — then **render ONE
       real slide in it to confirm fidelity** before building. **Once they pick, delete the throwaway
       `_directions/` preview files + rejected token-sets** (keep only the chosen style), then
       build the full deck in it — don't leave demo files littering Downloads.
     - *Picks design-one (via a named carve)* → build a single look shaped to purpose, as above.
     The gate is the DEFAULT on this branch, skipped only via the named carves above — a
     brand-new from-scratch deck is exactly when showing options pays off; "just design one
     and go" remains one click away, but it is the user's exception, never your shortcut.
   - *Generate a template with an image tool* → **a bespoke visual identity** — a styled, **text-free**
     hero/divider illustration, then reproduced natively so every content block fits it — for a vivid,
     designed deck (launch, event, brand, playful pitch) where a clean default isn't enough. **Follow
     `references/generated-template.md`**: a mini-interview *now* (scenario/topic first — brand colours
     fold into tailoring; **pick the 3 best-fit, deliberately DIVERSE styles for the TOPIC + CONTENT
     from its Style library** (different visual languages — e.g. Swiss vs Manga vs Glassmorphism — never
     colour-variations of one look). 🔴 **Each candidate is a whole STYLE, not a swapped picture: a
     distinct visual language WITH its own matched chrome (the `style.py` you derive per pick — palette,
     type, motif, component geometry), TOPIC-ADAPTED and novel — the same anti-mediocrity bar the
     "design a clean one" branch enforces mechanically (`directions_diversity.py`). Three generated
     images of the same subject in one look, or three that share a chrome, are the image-generation analogue of the
     "just different colours" failure — reject them.** **GENERATE 1 real template image per candidate
     style (2 for the
     front-runner) on this topic, and show them in ONE HTML gallery — the "style gate"** (one `file://`
     link; the winner's image is reused as the deck's hero, so the cost is ~3–4 images; native
     `archetypes_html.py` mockups are only the no-image-tool fallback), then the user picks. **Offer
     these as first-class, peer choices in the prompt — A / B / C (a shown style) · "describe your own /
     a reference" · and "Auto — let me pick the best-fit and just go" (an explicit option, not a
     fallback).** On Auto (or "you decide"), YOU select & name the topic-best-fit style and may SKIP the
     HTML gate, going straight to generate → the 🔴 hero checkpoint (still the real gate in the default
     flow; a full per-deck "decide everything yourself" directive downgrades it to a posted FYI like the
     other approval stops — "never a blind commit" is met by posting the renders, not by waiting)) →
     generate the text-free hero with a calm title zone (**no key** — native imagegen in Codex, else
     `generate_images_codex.py`; see `image-generation.md`) → **derive a matching `style.py`** (palette
     via `deckkit.palette_from_image`, motif + component helpers, so native blocks match) → render the
     cover + one real content slide and gate it:
     > **🔴 CHECKPOINT** — show the hero + a sample content slide; iterate until the user confirms.
     > *(A request to change the **atmosphere/mood/style** ⇒ RE-generate the imagery to embody it — new
     > subject/composition/lighting/motifs — then re-derive `style.py`; don't just recolour the old plate.
     > A minor palette/contrast tweak is a `style.py`-only change. See `references/generated-template.md`.)*
     Then **the look is decided — SKIP the direction gate**, finish the interview normally, and build
     (image cover/dividers with native title on top; content built natively in `style.py`. **🔴 MUST
     (this generated/image-tool template branch ONLY — not provided-template or "design a clean one" decks),
     not a default: also GENERATE a faint, TOPIC-RELATED interior-background PLATE (same style, the
     deck's own subject-matter motifs — never generic texture) and place it (lightly scrimmed) on
     every interior page — the shallow background is itself a generated image, not a flat/native fill —
     AND make content blocks FROSTED / semi-transparent (~30–45% see-through, α≈0.55–0.72), never flat
     opaque panels. Only the end pages — the cover, the section dividers, AND a closing/ending page that bookends the cover — carry full-strength imagery; interior
     pages get the faint plate.** Carve: a deliberately minimal/flat style (Swiss/Scandinavian/Brutalist)
     may use a faint native texture instead. Text kept ≥4.5:1; see `generated-template.md`); save the
     confirmed template to the registry.

   **Never hardcode or assume a specific institution's template.** This skill ships
   to anyone: a brand-new user has an *empty* registry, so they see only generic choices
   ("provide one", "design a clean one", and optionally "generate a template with an image
   tool") — no prior user's branding is ever offered to them.

2. **Purpose & audience.** "What's this deck for, and who's the audience?" Offer the
   common cases since the bar differs sharply between them:
   *research meeting with a supervisor* · *work status update to a manager/boss* ·
   *academic conference talk* · *academic job talk / faculty interview* ·
   *company/stakeholder readout* · *product description / pitch* · *thesis defense* ·
   *teaching* · *webinar / online presentation*. Get the **time budget**. This selects
   the critic's rubric (`references/review-rubrics.md`).
   - **Also capture two axes that the purpose alone doesn't pin down — ASK, don't infer them**
     (both change foundational design decisions *before* you build):
     - **Delivery context — presented live to a room · shared/screen-shared in a meeting · sent
       digitally / self-read.** This is the **single most design-determining answer**: it sets the
       deck's **delivery mode** (`design-principles.md` "Delivery mode"). A *presented* deck wants few
       words per slide + larger type + speaker notes; a *self-read* deck must be self-sufficient and can
       carry more text per surface. The same purpose can go either way (a status update presented vs
       emailed), so **don't infer it from the purpose or the density choice — ask it.** For self-read,
       there's no talking-time, so also get the **deck length** directly (short ~5–8 / medium ~9–15 /
       long 16+) instead of deriving it from minutes.
       **Canvas format rides on this answer:** an ordinary talk/meeting/self-read deck is 16:9 —
       never ask a format question there (16:9 is the unchanged default and every rule assumes it).
       But when the deliverable is a **non-slide surface** — a rednote/小红书 image note, an Instagram
       square post, a Story/Reels/Shorts vertical, an A4 print one-pager, an **A0/A1 conference
       poster**, or a venue demanding 4:3 —
       **confirm the canvas format** (one option-line, or fold into this question) and build on the
       matching `scripts/formats.py` preset: per-format safe zones, chrome policy, density, and
       layout DNA live in `references/canvas-formats.md`. Same identity + components, recomposed —
       never a 16:9 layout transplanted onto a portrait canvas.
       🔴 **A poster ask needs TWO answers, not one.** "Make me a poster for the conference" leaves
       the board size open (A0 and A1 are both standard, and the venue usually specifies), and it
       leaves the reading register open. Ask the size, and ask whether it is a **billboard** poster
       (one result, big, read in seconds) or a **traditional** one (the full argument, read
       standing) — they produce different section counts and different amounts of text at the same
       type floors, which do NOT move either way. Whichever they choose, methods and limitations
       are required content: they are what a passer-by cannot reconstruct and cannot fairly judge
       the claim without, and `scripts/check_surface.py` blocks a board that has neither.
     - **Deck length is ALWAYS the user's choice — surface it, never silently derive it.** Make it an
       explicit interview option: a **self-read** deck → ask **short ~5–8 / medium ~9–15 / long 16+**; a
       **spoken** deck → the **time budget** sets the working count (~1 slide/min), but still **confirm the
       resulting slide count** with the user at the Step-1 content checkpoint before building. Don't ship a
       length the user never saw (e.g. quietly building 14 slides because the content "felt like 14").
     - 🔴 **Two conditional asks, because a gate whose field nobody records is a gate that never
       binds.** This file's own opening says it: *an axis with no artifact demanding it is an axis
       that goes unasked*. Both of these have an artifact now, and neither is asked anywhere else.
       - **A deck the room can interrupt** (defense · guidance or thesis committee · grant panel ·
         board readout · conference talk with Q&A) → *"Which questions are you expecting, and which
         of them do you want a slide ready for?"* Record them as `content.qa`
         (`[{"question": …, "slide": <the backup that answers it>}]`); `scripts/check_qa_backup.py`
         then verifies each of those slides can be jumped to and left. Ask ONLY on those decks —
         a webinar or a teaching deck usually has no prepared answers, and asking everyone would
         turn the field into paperwork. *(Do not ask self-read decks at all.)*
       - **A deck that cites published work** (defense · journal club · lab meeting · grant ·
         literature review) → *"Do you have a .bib / reference list, and do you want numeric `[1]`
         or author-year `(Smith, 2020)` markers?"* Record it as `content.citations`
         (`{"bib": …, "style": …, "keys": [...]}` in cited order) and build the page with
         `citations.reference_page`, which derives every line from the .bib so a year cannot drift.
         If they have no .bib, say so and cite from what they gave you — do NOT retype references
         from memory, and do not offer to.
       - Both are OPTIONAL by design: the gates report NOT CHECKED when nothing is recorded, which
         is the right answer for a deck that has neither. The failure this bullet prevents is the
         other one — nobody asks, so nothing is recorded, so the gates are silent forever while
         looking green.
     - **Appear-builds (in-slide staged reveals) — the USER decides WHETHER; you decide WHERE.**
       A *presented* deck can reveal a slide's content one beat at a time on click so the room follows
       the speaker instead of reading ahead. **Whether to use builds at all is the user's call, offered
       explicitly — not a silent skill default** (recommended ON for a live talk, since an audience
       benefits, but a user who wants a plain click-through deck just says so). Ask this on **presented
       decks only** — *self-read / screen-shared-to-read* decks are static by design, so don't ask.
       If the user opts **IN**, YOU still choose WHERE (which slides earn a staged reveal) and each
       chosen slide is staged **FULLY** — every content element reveals in a deliberate reading order,
       nothing pre-shown but the title/frame (Step 4 / `references/animation.md`). If they opt **OUT**,
       the deck is static: no builds, and no `NO BUILDS` pressure (run lint with `--static`). Carry the
       choice into the design plan's motion manifest.
     - **Primary goal / intent — inform & educate · support a decision · inspire / motivate action.**
       This sets the **rhetorical arc**: *inform* builds to the evidence; *decide* leads with the
       recommendation and the ask; *inspire* opens on stakes and closes on a call to action. Purpose
       hints at it but doesn't fix it (a conference talk can inform *or* persuade) — so confirm it.
     - **Review effort — NOT asked here.** The `fast` · `standard` · `thorough` · `none` question
       is asked at **Step 5, after the first clean render, with the deck in front of the user**
       (SKILL.md → the post-build review question). At Step 0 it was a blind cost decision about a
       deck nobody had seen — which is why the cheap tier could never safely be the default. Do
       not add it back to the interview, and do not derive a review tier from the purpose.
     - **Research breadth — DERIVED from purpose, never asked.** Research runs before the deck
       exists, so it cannot wait for the post-build question; derive its breadth from the purpose
       and say the derived word in the plan:
       | purpose | derived research breadth |
       |---|---|
       | research/lab meeting · work status update · teaching · webinar / online presentation · **any tiny ask (1–2 slides, an internal note)** | `standard` |
       | academic conference talk · academic job talk / faculty interview · thesis defense · company/stakeholder readout · product description / pitch (customer, investor or internal) | `thorough` |
       A small ask does NOT lower the breadth; **purpose decides, size never does.** Breadth
       narrows the **sample** (how many sources, how deep the sweep), never the gate: the
       PRIMARY-SOURCE GATE and the fidelity floor hold at every breadth. Cost context, for when
       the user asks: a single low-stakes deck at full weight measured **~32 subagents and ~2M
       tokens across research + build + two review rounds**, research and review comparable in
       size (~1.02M vs ~0.95M tokens on one measured deck) — and the build, not the review, is
       the biggest wall-clock slice at 40–71% of model-active minutes.
   - *(Structure emphasis — data/trends vs narrative-insights vs sector/section breakdown — and the
     fine-grained slide count are best steered at the **Step-1 content checkpoint**, where the user
     approves the arc, rather than front-loaded here — keep this interview cheap.)*
   - **Webinar / online presentation** = a talk delivered over video, watched in a shrunk
     window on mixed-size screens. Build it like a conference talk but for a shared screen:
     larger type, light background, content in the central safe area, more/lighter slides
     to hold a remote audience, and "ask in the chat" prompts (see `design-by-purpose.md`).
   - **Academic job talk / faculty interview** = a candidate selling their research
     *program* + vision + fit to a hiring department (not one paper to peers). Unlike a
     conference talk it's longer (~45 min), personal, and must connect past work into one
     through-line and a concrete future agenda — so don't model it as a long conference talk.
   - **Product description / pitch** = presenting or selling a *product* to
     prospects, customers, or users (launch deck, sales pitch, product overview) —
     distinct from a *stakeholder readout* (which reports business status/decisions).
     Lead with the value proposition, sell benefits over features, show the real
     product, and end on a call to action. If it targets a named market/event or has
     a brand, treat that like a venue/template and research/honor it. **Confirm the
     audience: an *investor* pitch (raising capital) is a distinct variant** — it sells
     the company/opportunity (market, traction, business model, team, the ask), not just
     the product, so ask "investors, customers/users, or internal stakeholders?" and judge
     it against the investor overlay in `references/review-rubrics.md`.
   - **Conference talk → ALWAYS identify and research the specific venue.** First
     ask *which* conference and (if relevant) which track/format — oral, spotlight,
     poster (e.g. MICCAI, ISMRM, NeurIPS, RSNA, CVPR). **This is required, not
     optional: never build a "generic conference" deck.** Then **web-search the
     named venue** even if you think you know it (guidelines change yearly) to learn:
     talk length & slot, slide aspect ratio, file/format rules, whether an
     **official template** exists (fetch & use it if so), the **audience**
     composition (specialists vs. broad), and what a *strong talk at this venue*
     looks like (single-message expectations, how technical, clinical vs. ML
     framing, Q&A norms, any companion poster). Venue norms vary widely — a clinical
     society ≠ an ML conference — so ground every choice in what you find, cite it
     back to the user, and fold it into the plan, the build, and the critic's rubric.
     If the host exposes no web tool, apply the same fallback as Step 1's no-source
     rule: ask the USER for the venue specs (slot length, aspect ratio, official
     template, audience) instead of searching — never guess them.
     - *Poster, not a talk?* A conference **poster** is a different artifact — one large
       single-canvas layout, not a sequence of slides — so the deck arc and the per-slide
       rubric don't apply directly. `deckkit` can build a single large-canvas "slide"
       (`blank_deck(w_in, h_in)` at the poster's real size, e.g. 33×47 in / A0), and the
       craft rules still hold (whole figures, hierarchy, contrast, one clear story), but
       say plainly that this skill is tuned for *talks* — confirm size/orientation and
       the venue's poster spec before building.

3. **Source material.** "Do you have content for me to work from — code, a paper, a PDF,
   a Word/PowerPoint/Excel file, a doc, existing slides, figures/images, a video or recording?"
   - *Yes* → **dig in deeply** (step 1, content branch): read it properly and build
     from the real material. (But per "requirements first" above — if they didn't
     ask you to reuse a provided deck's *content/wording* as-is, mine it for facts
     and figures, don't inherit its structure or text.) **Route each format to its ingest
     path (content-planner §1 "Input formats") — each dedicated extractor kept uncrossed:** a **`.docx`**
     → `scripts/ingest.py doctext` (exact; a long/book-length one → `ingest.py office`→PDF so long-source
     triage applies); **`.pptx`** → `extract_deck.py` (native — the redesign path); **`.xlsx`** →
     `ingest.py sheet` (exact rows; NOT office→PDF, which drops data); **PDF** → `extract_pdf.py`; an
     **image** → read with vision (understand + place the pixels freely; a number/quote you *type* off
     it is `verified? = N` until confirmed — no OCR here); a **video** → **ask for a transcript** for the
     spoken content + `ingest.py frames` for visuals (no speech-to-text, so narration you can't hear is a
     gap, never invented); **audio-only / a cloud doc (Google/Notion/URL)** → ask for a transcript /
     an exported file respectively. The fidelity floor: text extracts exactly; pixels/audio are
     `verified? = N` until confirmed.
   - *No* → **build the content yourself** from your knowledge, and **web-search to
     ground it** (correct facts, current numbers, credible framing) rather than
     inventing. Confirm the intended scope/outline with the user before building.
   - 🔴 **When material IS provided, ASK whether to supplement it from the web — and bring your
     own read of what is missing.** "They gave me a source" is not the same as "the deck has what
     it needs", and a provided source is the case where the gap is *least* visible: the material
     looks complete because it is complete *for its own purpose*, which is rarely the deck's
     purpose. Make it one option-line in the same batch, **pre-filled with the specific gaps you
     can already name from a first scan** — not a bare "want me to search?", which puts the
     diagnosis on the user and reliably gets "no".
     The recurring gap classes, in the order they actually bite:
     - **Time-bound claims in the source have gone stale.** A paper's "state-of-the-art", an
       adoption number, a "first/largest/latest" superlative, a price, a policy, a headcount.
       Re-verifying a source claim is not inventing — it is fidelity to what is true *now*
       (this is the same rule as SKILL.md's "re-verify the source's own falsifiable claims at
       TODAY's date"; the interview is where the user gets to authorise the searches it costs).
     - **The source ends where the deck's audience begins** — a method paper with no
       related-work-since-publication, a repo with no writeup, an internal memo with no market
       context, figures with no prose.
     - **The venue / audience / competitor context is nowhere in the material**, because the
       material was never written for that room.
     - **One named asset the deck will need and the source does not carry** — an official logo,
       a brand colour, a licensed photo, a spec number. These are few, they are cheap, and per
       the SEARCH BUDGET rule they are exactly what starves if a research fan-out runs first.
     Offer three answers, and record which one was chosen: **(a) source only — do not search**
     (the right answer for a self-contained document, a fixed-scope internal deck, or anything
     confidential); **(b) supplement the named gaps only** (default when you can name any);
     **(c) supplement freely within a stated cap**. On (a), any claim the source leaves
     unverifiable stays flagged in the ledger rather than quietly filled from memory — 🔴 a
     source-only deck may not be grounded by recall.

## Step 0 — Q4 (style): density levels, mimic modes, and the direction-gate scope

4. **Style.** "How do you want it to look and feel?" Offer these (applies to *every*
   purpose):
   - **Density — ALWAYS a surfaced choice, defined by TEXT-PER-POINT (not "text vs no text").** EVERY
     level has *both* text and visuals; what changes is how much each *point* says and how much the
     diagram carries. Offer three concrete levels (this is the "text-heavy vs diagram-heavy" question):
     - **Diagram-heavy** — *a phrase per point* (~3–7 words); a diagram / figure / chart carries the
       idea, the text is a terse label or takeaway. Lets an audience follow a *speaker*. (Presented default.)
     - **Balanced** — *one short sentence per point* + a supporting visual; scannable live, still mostly
       clear when skimmed.
     - **Text-heavy** — *2–3 self-contained sentences per point* (a short paragraph); the slide reads on
       its own without a speaker, visuals support the prose. For a **read-without-a-speaker** artifact —
       leave-behind, emailed/reference/appendix deck, board pre-read, **poster**, single-slide
       **infographic** — that fuller text is the deliverable, not a flaw.
     **Surface it explicitly (like deck length) and scale the options to delivery (Q2):** a **presented**
     deck → *diagram-heavy (recommended) ↔ balanced* (a text-heavy presented deck is a wall of text —
     steer away); a **self-read / poster** deck → *balanced ↔ text-heavy*. Don't silently decide it from
     the purpose. (This sets the deck's **delivery mode** — see `references/design-principles.md`.)
   - **"Mimic an example I'll provide"** — the user hands over a **whole deck, a few slides, or even ONE
     slide / screenshot** whose design they want echoed. Different from a *template* (Q1): you do NOT
     build on it or inherit its logos/content — you reproduce what they value in your own build.
     **First ask which INTENT** (they mean one of two — the build differs):
     - **(1) Reproduce the look** — same family: match the example's **palette, fonts, motifs, density**
       (a faithful style clone, with the user's content).
     - **(2) Borrow its components & layout, but redesign the style for MY topic** — keep the example's
       *structure + component vocabulary* (its card style, callout, diagram/layout pattern, signature
       motif) but **re-choose the palette / mood / type to fit the topic** and refill with the user's
       content ("inspired by, not copied"). *This is the common ask* ("mimic but not copy, restyle for
       the topic, apply some of its components").
     Then **understand it before building** — a glance won't do (for a single slide, treat its treatment
     as the deck-wide system, confirming with the user). Write the structured **style brief** (structure/
     rhythm, grid, colour, type, decorations & motifs, the **2–4 components worth reusing**, tone) and
     build per the chosen mode — **follow `references/style-analysis.md`** (Mode A reproduces; Mode B
     borrows components + restyles to the topic), keeping the user's content + the craft rules. Composes
     with everything (e.g. build on the user's template for branding, yet borrow an example's components).
   - Plus any tone (academic, corporate, playful).
   Honor their choice over your own habits; nudge toward concise + visual when
   unsure; carry the choice into the plan (steps 1–2) and the build (step 4).
   - **Direction gate (when to show rendered options first).** Two cases call for it:
     (a) **"design a clean one" / no template** → it's the *recommended default* there —
     offer **4** directions as described in Q1's design-one branch above (>=1 bespoke register + best-fit DNA presets +
     1 colour-scheme direction); (b) any other case where the user is **unsure on style** or it's a
     **brand-defining / high-stakes** deck → offer **2–3 directions** as a lighter opt-in. Either way it's the same machinery
     (collaborative mode Gate A, `references/collaborative-mode.md` + `scripts/archetypes_html.py`):
     **one HTML link** showing the archetype slides per direction, which the user opens and picks
     from before the full build. **Scope differs by case, and the difference matters:** on case (a)
     — the no-template branch — the gate **RUNS BY DEFAULT** and is skippable only via one of Q1(c)'s
     NAMED carves, recorded on the checkpoint's `direction gate:` line (a design checkpoint on that
     branch with no gate line is not ready). Only case (b), the lighter unsure/brand-defining offer,
     is **skippable, never forced.** A *registered or provided* template, **a generated template** (Q1's image-tool
     branch), **or a Mode-A mimic example** (Q4 "reproduce the look")
     means the look is already decided — **don't offer the gate** in those cases. (A Mode-B mimic
     stays eligible for the lighter case-(b) offer — its palette/mood is re-chosen for the topic.)
