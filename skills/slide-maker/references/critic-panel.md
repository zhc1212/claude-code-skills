# Critic panel

## The CONTRACT CARD — full field list

**Before dispatching the CONTENT lens on a source-backed deck, run
`python3 scripts/trace_composed.py <deck>.pptx --source <the source files>` and hand the critic
its COMPOSED list.** It splits the shipped lines into source-quoted and author-composed, and the
content defects live in the second set: on one measured deck all three of the worst — an invented
product mechanism, a process gate attributed to the wrong step, a required install line silently
dropped — were lines written from memory of the source hours after reading it, while every
verbatim-quoted line was clean. Aiming the lens at those lines instead of re-reading twelve pages
is the cheapest real reduction available in this loop. It also reports, exactly rather than
heuristically, any NUMBER or identifier on a slide that appears nowhere in the source — that class
caught a wrapped install command whose visible text copied as a 404 path. It is triage, not a
verdict: a composed line is not wrong, it is simply unquoted, so nothing but a reader can confirm it.

   - **The CONTRACT CARD — assemble it at dispatch, from the approved plans (declarations only,
     never rationale).** A compact artifact the coordinator builds for every pipeline-built deck:
     the **deck memory sentence + emotional-curve line** (peak marked), the **per-slide
     takeaway / role / question / beat table**, the **claim ledger**, the **per-figure
     carrying-element rows**, **on a long-source deck the `source size:` line + the approved
     Source-coverage map** (the per-section disposition rows + the verbatim-vs-skimmed line — the
     critics judge completeness against its built-around/summarised set, NOT the whole book, and
     read a `cut` row as a conscious cut), **on a video-sourced deck the transcript status**
     (supplied-transcript locator, or the "video read visual-only — spoken content is a GAP" line),
     and the Design plan's **declared contracts** — **the `concept:` line (what this deck's idea is a
     PICTURE of, plus the two pictures it beat)**, so the distinctiveness lens can ask the one
     question nothing else in the loop asks: *does the built deck look like the picture it said it
     was?* Without it the concept is a field that gets filled at plan time and is never tested
     against pixels — the exact aspiration-without-enforcement shape this skill keeps rediscovering,
     and the reason `signature move` grew a `signature_proof` and `carried_by` grew a structural
     count. The skeleton rhythm
     map, the WOW slide(s), the money slide (the slide the deck exists for), **the `boldness:` dial +
     the `signature move:` line INCLUDING its `carried_by:` slides** (so the distinctiveness lens can
     judge whether the declared risk actually landed in the pixels or got sanded back to safe — and,
     on the named carry slides specifically, whether the idea does structural work there or was
     merely stamped), **the branch's gate line** (`direction gate:` / `style gate:`, so a look that
     was never chosen from alternatives is visible as such) **with the picked composition tokens**
     (`cover <token> · home skeleton <token>` — the design lens checks the BUILT cover against the
     archetype the user picked, and the rhythm map's plurality against the picked skeleton), the semantic-colour
     ledger, the type tokens, the **`interior register:` cue** (the quiet register signature that
     repeats on interior slides, or `none (flat by register — <reason>)` — the critic's
     `register_interiors` check reads it), the motion manifest, the **chosen preset name + its `guard` string
     verbatim** (or `custom look — no preset guards`) (on the generated-template branch, plus the four identity-propagation contract lines — palette · type register · component geometry · surface), the **`signature proof:` token**
     (one entry per ANCHOR — `signature slide N → <png> · complex slide M → <png> · data slide K →
     <png>`, or `skipped: <carve>` — so the critic compares each SHIPPED anchor
     against the frame that was approved before the rest of the deck existed, and a silent skip is
     visible. Three anchors rather than one because the signature page only ever proved the
     aesthetic risk: whether the design HOLDS the deck's densest page and whether the charts speak
     its visual language are separate questions, and both used to reach the critic for the first
     time at full deck size, where the fix is a rebuild), the **`logo plan:` line with its evidence
     token**, the **checkpoint motif line** (device + meaning + legibility mode), the **approved
     image opt-in rows with their per-row source tokens** (+ license/credit notes and any declared
     stylized deviation), and — **when a Q4 style example is in play** —
     the **chosen mimic mode (A/B) + style-brief pointer** (so the design lens judges style against
     the right bar: a Mode-B restyle's deliberately-different palette is correct, not a fidelity
     miss). Like the motion manifest it extends, the
     card carries **intent the pixels can't show**: the judges verify the RENDER honors what the
     deck DECLARES — they never re-litigate the approved declarations themselves, and pixels
     always win over a kept-but-bad promise. Fidelity stays **source-first**: a ledger row is
     corroboration for a number, never a substitute for its source location.
     **On any post-first round driven by user feedback**, also fold in that round's **`user-dials:`
     line(s)** — a neutral record of *dimension → direction, layer — "the user's verbatim words"*
     (NOT prior-critic output, so the fresh-critic-unanchored rule below is untouched); it is the
     evidence the pendulum-overshoot check cites (`review-rubrics.md` §9), so the critic judges an
     overshoot against the user's actual words, not a reconstruction. For an external
     deck under review/redesign or a direction preview (no Step-1 plan exists), state
     "none-declared" explicitly in the dispatch instead.

## Cutting a review's cost — what was MEASURED, and what was not

A controlled A/B on the skill's own 7-slide defect fixture (`tests/lint_fixture.py`, seven
planted defects), two design critics, identical except for how they read:

| | A: open every slide, read rubric + design-principles | B: survey sheet first, rubric only |
|---|---|---|
| tokens | 93,918 | **68,416  (-27%)** |
| wall clock | 159.5s | **124.7s  (-22%)** |
| planted defects found | 5/5 | **5/5** |

Recall held. But the saving did **not** come from where it was expected:

🔴 **The contact sheet saved nothing. B opened all seven slides at full size anyway**
(`slides_opened_full: [1..7]`), because "open only what looks suspect" is prose with no
backstop — exactly the class of instruction a model skips with nothing to report it. The
-27% is almost entirely the reference load: `design-principles.md` (~20.5k tok) plus the
rubric's per-purpose and high-stakes sections (~4.1k tok) = ~24.6k, against a measured
delta of 25.5k.

So: **the lever is what a critic READS, not how many images it opens.** Per critic, the
standing reference load is ~62.6k tokens — `agents/critic.md` ~24.8k, `review-rubrics.md`
~17.4k, `design-principles.md` ~20.5k — which on a four-lens round is ~250k spent
re-reading three files. Images are ~1.5k each, so a whole 12-slide deck is ~18k: an order
of magnitude less.

**What is safe to act on today** (a deck needs exactly one of these, by construction):
- the rubric's nine per-purpose sections — read only the one matching this deck's purpose
- `## Finding-level cross-validation (high-stakes only)` — skip it at `fast` / `standard`

**What is NOT yet established.** B also skipped `design-principles.md` entirely and still
found 5/5 — but the fixture's planted defects are layout faults the Universal rubric already
covers. That is one run on one deck; it is NOT evidence that a design lens can drop the craft
reference on a deck with subtler problems. Do not generalise from it without a second
experiment on a deck whose defects are craft-level rather than geometric.

**If the contact sheet is to earn its place, it needs a backstop, not a paragraph** — the
review schema would have to require `slides_opened_full` with a reason per slide, so the cost
is auditable and opening all twelve has to be justified twelve times. Until that exists,
treat `scripts/contact_sheet.py` as a convenience for a human skimming a deck, not as a
critic-time optimisation.

🔴 **Whatever you cut, cut COST, never SCOPE.** A fresh reviewer told "check 3, 6 and 8"
cannot catch the regression you introduced on slide 10 — and a second round exists precisely
because round 1's fixes are themselves unreviewed changes. (History: a scoped round 2 was
proposed once and demolished in audit for exactly this reason.)

**Before spending a round on a defect class, ask whether a lint could decide it.** Measured
example: a caption sized for one line that rendered as two, dropping its second line onto the
footer, survived a full round-1 review and was found only by round 2 — because `measure_text`
under-reported bold width in font-collection families, so the build-time assert and the build
lint both passed. Fixing the measurement moved that whole class to a CRITICAL that fires in
milliseconds. A round spent finding what a lint could have decided is a round wasted.

## Handling a returned review — strengths, probes, and ceilings

   - **Consume the previous round's `strengths` as a do-not-harm ledger.** On every fix round,
     pass the prior critic's `strengths` array to the ACTOR alongside the promoted fixes,
     labeled: *"protected — do not degrade these while fixing; if a fix forces a trade-off
     against a named strength, declare it in the change manifest rather than trading silently."*
     Do NOT hand strengths to the next round's fresh critic — the whole-deck re-pass stays
     unanchored.
   - **Diff the critic's recorded probes against the plan (cheap, coordinator-side).** The
     critic returns per-slide `{first_read, takeaway_guess}` thumbnails probes and a
     `memory_sentence`. Flag a slide ONLY when its `takeaway_guess` is a bare topic label
     carrying no message, or lands on a different message/emphasis than the plan's recorded
     takeaway — a coarser-but-aligned guess passes; flag `memory_sentence` only when it "isn't
     close to" the planned deck message (the rubric's own bar). Anti-fabrication tell: per-slide
     guesses that echo the plan's takeaway phrasing verbatim/near-verbatim invalidate the probe,
     the same way a `slides_opened` gap invalidates the review. Disposition — never auto-revise,
     never a user stop: low-stakes → hand the mismatch back to the same critic in the same round
     to reconcile (raise the finding, or state in one clause why the probe passes); high-stakes →
     it enters the arbiter pass as a candidate finding like any other.
   - **Ceilings are contained.** On a panel, keep the single strongest `ceiling` and discard the
     rest (reason unrecorded — it is not a finding); ceilings are never sent to arbiters, never
     enter the fix list, and never trigger or extend a round — their only consumer is the Step-6
     hand-off line.

## Review effort tiers — what the user's one word actually dispatches

The one-word `review:` tier is collected at the **post-build review question** (SKILL.md, Step 5 —
asked AFTER the first clean render, with the rendered deck posted alongside it; never at Step 0).
Four answers: `fast` (the pre-selected default) | `standard` | `thorough` | `none`. The tier
scales the **weight** of the loop; only the user's explicit `none` scales away its **existence** —
see the floors at the end of this section.

| | `fast` (default) | `standard` | `thorough` | `none` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| critics per round | **1 generalist**, carrying BOTH lenses | **2 focused**, one lens each | exactly what "Panel composition by stakes" below already prescribes for high-stakes, including its light-vs-full sub-scaling by length and scope | — nothing dispatched |
| arbitration | none | **none** — identical to today's low-stakes | per that same section: skipped at the light end, full cross-validation on a long/career-defining deck | — |
| round cap | **1** | 2 | 3 | **0** |
| round-2 scope | n/a | a **full fresh** whole-deck re-review | a **full fresh** whole-deck re-review | n/a |
| consent | the critic's own | the critic's own | corroborated, wherever that section already requires it | none ran — recorded as `user-waived` |
| provenance sample | top ~5 load-bearing claims | top ~10 | fan-out over all of them | **skipped** — hand-off `provenance:` line says so |
| measured order of magnitude | ~6 subagents · ~250k tok | ~12 · ~600k | ~32 · ~2M | 0 |

**`standard` and `thorough` are pure ALIASES for today's low-stakes and high-stakes — every cell
above either restates that section or defers to it.** `fast` is the one genuinely new band, and it
is the **default** because the choice is made with the rendered deck visible: the user has already
judged the thing itself, so the known recall drop of a single generalist round is an *informed*
trade, stated in the option text (cost, wall-clock, what is skipped) — never a silent downgrade.
🔴 **`none` exists only as the user's own answer to the post-build question** — it is never
derived, never the auto-waiver pick, and never inferred from silence; it writes the standard
`user-waived` critic waiver into `.deck-gates.json` quoting the decline, and on a
research-sourced deck its option text must say it also skips the adversarial primary-source
re-check (the provenance gate rides on the loop).
*(An earlier draft also had `standard` narrow round-2 to the changed slides and gain a "triggered"
arbiter pass. Both were dropped: the first is rejected by the review-validation gate, whose
`slides_opened` scope buckets are whole-deck and per-section only, so a scoped round 2 bounces and
costs an extra round instead of saving one; the second contradicts four surviving statements that
low-stakes dispatches no arbiter at all, including `agents/arbiter.md`'s own brief. Either could
return later as its own change that edits every one of those files — neither belongs in a dial
whose value is that it changes nothing by default.)*

**When the question cannot be asked — run the default `fast`, and say so.** Because the question
is post-render, every path that reaches Step 5 can ask it — a redesign, a critique of an existing
deck, an external deck with no Step-1 plan all included. The only runs that skip the ask are
non-interactive ones (a per-deck auto waiver, a headless dispatch): there the tier is `fast` and
the hand-off records `review: fast (post-build default — not asked: <why>)`. Never resolve a
missing answer to `none`. A tier that is silently undefined is how a default becomes whatever the
run happened to feel like.

**🔴 Two shapes no tier may alter, because they are not weight** (they bind every tier that RUNS —
`none` dispatches nothing, so nothing here applies to it). (1) On a **large deck (~15+
slides)**, the per-section critics plus the one whole-deck coherence critic run at EVERY tier
(`references/large-deck-orchestration.md`) — the tier moves rounds and the provenance sample, never
the sectioned panel shape; a 40-slide deck reviewed as one document is not a cheaper review, it is
a different and worse one. (2) **Corroborated consent stays required wherever the stakes section
requires it.** A user word may buy fewer rounds; it may not buy consent that nobody checked on the
deck class where that check gates shipping.

**Report the bill.** A dial the user sets but never sees the cost of builds no intuition, so the
Step-6 hand-off carries a `cost:` line (subagents · tokens · wall-clock) beside the `review:`
line — `references/handoff-checklist.md` owns both.

## Panel composition by stakes, and arbiter cross-validation

     - *Low-stakes* (research/lab meeting, work status update, teaching) → **two FOCUSED lens
       critics in parallel** — one **Lens A (content · fidelity · narrative)** and one **Lens B
       (design · layout · legibility)** per `agents/critic.md` §2, each applying **only its lens**
       (plus the shared high-recurrence box). Two focused agents catch far more than one generalist
       wading through all ~30 checks, at the same wall-clock; **skip the arbiter pass** for low-stakes.
     - *High-stakes* (conference, academic job talk / faculty interview, thesis
       defense, exec/stakeholder/pitch) → dispatch a
       **panel of 2–3 critics in parallel, each assigned ONE lens** from `critic.md` §2 (Lens A
       content/fidelity, Lens B design/layout, + optionally a back-of-room/audience pass), then **merge
       and de-dup** their findings — independent, *focused* reviewers catch far more than one, in
       parallel at no extra wall-clock. **Each critic reads `critic.md` but applies only its assigned
       lens, so no single agent carries the whole ~30-check brief** (the load split that prevents
       missed checks). **Scale the panel *within* high-stakes by length & scope, not just
       purpose:** a short single-paper talk (e.g. a ~10-min conference oral) takes the
       **light** end — 2 critics, and **skip the arbiter pass** below; a long, career-
       defining deck (a 45-min job talk, thesis defense, or investor pitch) earns the
       **full** 2–3-critic panel **plus** that arbiter cross-validation. For a **large deck (~15+ slides)** — a size threshold, NOT "was it built by section authors": from ~9 slides the BUILD fans out (`references/large-deck-orchestration.md`) while the review stays whole-deck — add **per-section critics plus one
       whole-deck critic for coherence/arc/seams**, then — after the arbiter pass below —
       **route only the *promoted* findings** back to the section that owns each slide
       (see `references/large-deck-orchestration.md`). Keep
       every critic **independent** — it judges the rendered pixels, it doesn't
       co-design; that independence is what makes consent mean something.
     - **Then cross-validate the findings before acting on them (full-panel decks above).** A
       merged panel is still a *union* of opinions: a critic can flag a number as wrong
       when it's right, or demand a change that would crowd a slide already at its
       legibility floor — and merging alone acts on that blindly. So add **one parallel
       pass of independent arbiters** (`agents/arbiter.md`) over the candidate findings,
       each judging only the rendered pixels + source — **handed the CONTRACT CARD too**
       (the fidelity re-derivation in `arbiter.md` is defined against the claim ledger and
       carrying-element rows it carries; the source stays ground truth): is the finding **real** (re-derive
       it — recompute the number, look at the actual pixels), and would its fix **help or
       hurt**? Promote to the fix list only what survives; **discard the rest with the
       reason recorded, never silently.** Because the costs are asymmetric, a **blocker
       survives unless arbiters actively refute it** (don't ship a wrong number because
       two agents shrugged "unsure"), and a **lone finding on a critic's home turf** —
       the content critic on a number, the design critic on overflow — is trusted even if
       only one critic raised it, so a real flaw isn't drowned by de-dup; a *minor* is **not sent
       to the arbiters** and the coordinator promotes it only when a clear majority of the
       *critics* independently raised it; a finding that is **real but whose fix
       hurts** is promoted with the arbiters' *better* fix, not dropped. The exact
       promote/discard rule lives in `references/review-rubrics.md` so it stays
       consistent. Net effect: the actor fixes real flaws, not phantoms. **Low-stakes
       skips the arbiter/confirmation machinery** — just the two focused lens critics, merge, one consent.

## High-stakes — verify the fixes and corroborate consent

**High-stakes only — verify the fixes and corroborate consent.** On re-render, the
arbiters cheaply re-check each promoted finding against the actor's **change manifest**
(what changed + which slides were touched): did the fix actually land *in the pixels*,
and did it regress a neighbour? **Hand this pass the previous critic's `strengths` list +
the manifest's declared trade-offs too — its Job-2 JSON carries a required `dulled` flag**
(did the fix buy its resolution by subtracting declared drama — a named strength degraded,
the hero/WOW demoted, a build removed?); `dulled: true` re-opens the finding with a
`better_fix`, exactly like `resolved: false`. A fix that didn't land **stays open** instead of
vanishing. And accept final consent only when the critic's `verdict == "consent"` **and**
a confirmation pass — a panel member who didn't author this round's edits, or one fresh
arbiter if the panel agreed in lockstep — sees no surviving blocker/major; consent should
be *corroborated*, not one agent's say-so. **Fail loudly at the cap:** if rounds are
exhausted and a *contested* blocker remains (the raiser calls it a blocker, the arbiters
can't refute it, or the confirmation pass splits), don't silently ship — hand the user
that one disagreement in step 6 as an honest question ("two reviewers disagree on whether
the Table 2 number matches the source — please confirm"). Arbitration is parallel breadth
*within* a round; it never adds rounds, and the caps above are unchanged. (Because it
removes phantom fixes and slide-thrash, expected rounds-to-consent often *drops*.)
