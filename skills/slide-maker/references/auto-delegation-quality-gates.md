# Auto-delegation quality gates

## Purpose

When the user delegates decisions with "decide everything yourself" / "auto mode" / similar
directives, the skill MUST maintain the same quality bar and process rigor as user-supervised
mode. **Delegation is not permission to skip steps or lower standards** — it is permission to
make defensible choices yourself rather than asking.

## Core principle: Auto means "you choose", not "skip"

**Every workflow step still runs.** The checkpoints are still posted, the agents still produce
their artifacts, the critic panel still reviews. What changes:

- ✅ You answer the Step-0 interview questions yourself (with derived, defensible picks).
- ✅ You design the visual language yourself (within the design-intelligence targets).
- ✅ You build without waiting for explicit "proceed" — but only AFTER posting each checkpoint
  for async veto (user can interrupt if they see it and disagree).
- ❌ You do NOT skip the content plan agent.
- ❌ You do NOT skip the design plan agent.
- ❌ You do NOT skip rendering and the full critic panel.
- ❌ You do NOT compress multiple steps into one pass.

## Checkpoint protocol under auto delegation

1. **Post each checkpoint artifact as specified** in `checkpoint-convention.md`:
   - Content checkpoint: full content plan with source-trace table, 角色/记忆句, digest
   - Design checkpoint: visual language, form ledger, signature move, rhythm map, all gates
   
2. **Give the user a brief moment to interrupt** (one conversational beat):
   ```
   [Post checkpoint artifact]
   
   Content plan ready. Proceeding to design phase in auto mode — interrupt if you want 
   to adjust the scope or angle.
   
   [Brief pause, then continue if no interrupt]
   ```

3. **If interrupted, stop and address the feedback.** Then resume from that checkpoint.

4. **Never write "I'll skip X because you said auto"** — that reasoning is invalid. Auto
   delegation covers *preferences*, not *process steps*.

## Quality enforcement in auto mode

### Review tier in auto mode

🔴 **Auto runs the post-build default, `fast` — and may never pick `none`.** The review question
is asked at Step 5 with the deck visible; under auto it is posted as an FYI, not a stop
(`review: fast (post-build default — auto)`). Declining review entirely is a decision only the
user can make, with the deck in front of them. Auto may ESCALATE above `fast` for a high-stakes
purpose (defense / exec readout / pitch) and must record the reason:
`review: standard (escalated — defense deck, auto)`. The surviving-blocker rule still applies at
`fast`: a blocker the single round cannot absorb goes back to the USER named, never shipped.

### Design targets (must meet)

Even when you design the visual language yourself, you MUST hit the targets in
`design-intelligence-addendum.md`:
- ✅ 2-3 title treatments rotated (not the same chrome on every slide)
- ✅ Signature move appears 2-4 times (establishes visual identity)
- ✅ Rhythm variation (not all slides the same form)
- ✅ Color discipline (accent used deliberately, not everywhere)

### Image generation: topic relevance + text legibility

When generating images for slides, enforce BOTH:

1. **Strong topic relevance** (images must advance understanding, not just "look nice")
2. **Text legibility protection** (images used as backgrounds MUST NOT interfere with reading)

#### Image placement rules for auto mode

**A. Hero/atmosphere plates (full-bleed backgrounds):**

Use **`dk.scrim_overlay`** — the helper written for exactly this job. It emits a GRADIENT
fill, which is the only way a scrim can carry transparency: `<a:alpha>` lives on gradient
stops, and DrawingML's alpha scale is **0–100000**, not 0–255.

```python
# 1. Place the plate
dk.picture(slide, img_path, 0, 0, 10, 5.625, fit="cover", alt="<what it shows>")

# 2. Graduated scrim, AIMED at the text (angle 0 = darker at left, 90 = darker at bottom).
#    Size it to the text's zone — a flat slab over the whole slide flattens the image.
dk.scrim_overlay(slide, 0, 0, 10, 5.625,
                 stops=((0.0, 0.82), (0.55, 0.55), (1.0, 0.12)),
                 color="0A1420", angle=0.0)

# 3. Text on top
```

🔴 **Never write `shape.fill.fore_color.alpha = ...`.** python-pptx's `ColorFormat` has no
`alpha` setter and no `__slots__`, so the assignment **silently creates a dead attribute** and
raises nothing. The emitted XML is `<a:srgbClr val="000000"/>` with **no `<a:alpha>`** — a 100%
**opaque** rectangle that erases the plate entirely. Measured on a real deck: brightest pixel in
the image region **0/765**, and **every lint passed green** — text is painted last so
`TEXT NOT VISIBLE`/`OCCLUSION` cannot fire, and white-on-pure-black scores ~21:1 so
`TEXT-ON-IMAGE CONTRAST` reports the *best* number in the deck. A solid fill cannot be
translucent; reach for the gradient helper, or `deckkit.pic_alpha` to fade the picture itself.

**Text over a plate must be legible — but a scrim is only one way to get there, and not always
the right one.** When the plate already carries a calm dark region where the type sits, a scrim
subtracts from the image and adds nothing. Measure first with `image_fx.quiet_region(path)`,
then decide. `TEXT-ON-IMAGE CONTRAST` backstops the too-light direction; **nothing backstops the
too-heavy direction**, so that judgement is yours and it is the one that quietly ruins covers.

**B. Side panels / content plates (images as visual support, not backgrounds):**

These are placed BESIDE text, not under it:
```python
# Image in right 40% of slide
dk.picture(slide, img_path, 6.0, 1.0, 3.5, 3.5, fit="contain", alt="Topic illustration")

# Text in left 60%, no overlap
dk.text(slide, 0.8, 1.5, 5.0, 3.5, content)
```

No scrim needed — text has its own opaque background (the slide fill).

**C. Icon/diagram supplements:**

Small, non-decorative images that clarify content:
```python
# Icon tile with background — the param is `fill=`, not `tile_color=`.
# icon_tile reads the icon's own ink and auto-nudges the tile to >=3:1, so prefer it
# over hand-placing an icon on a raw box.
dk.icon_tile(slide, x, y, size, icon_path, fill=accent, glyph="white")

# Or inline diagram
dk.picture(slide, diagram_path, x, y, w, h, fit="contain", alt="Architecture diagram")
```

#### Image generation prompt discipline

When you decide an image would help, the prompt MUST:

1. **Describe the topic concept** (not just "abstract background"):
   ❌ "Abstract technology background with blue gradient"
   ✅ "Neural network architecture diagram showing interconnected layers, technical 
       schematic style, clean lines"

2. **Specify composition for text legibility** when used as background:
   - "with large empty calm region in [position] for text overlay"
   - "dark/light uniform background gradient"
   - "vignette darkening at edges, bright center"
   
3. **Declare the art direction** (match the deck's visual language):
   - If deck is "clean geometric" → "minimal geometric shapes, no texture"
   - If deck is "research technical" → "schematic, blueprint style, no decoration"
   - If deck is "warm human-centered" → "soft illustrations, approachable"

4. **Exclude text/labels in the image** (always):
   - Add to every prompt: "no text, no labels, no annotations"
   - Text belongs in native PowerPoint objects (editable, searchable, accessible)

#### When NOT to generate images (auto mode discipline)

Even in auto mode, do NOT generate images just because you can. Generate only when:

✅ The image would **clarify a concept** that's hard to describe in words alone
✅ The deck's purpose/audience expects visual richness (conference > internal meeting)
✅ You can describe a prompt that's **topic-specific** (not generic stock vibes)

❌ Do NOT generate for:
- Every slide "to make it look better" (visual clutter)
- Generic "technology/business" atmosphere (vague, low information)
- Covering up sparse content (fix the content instead)

**Default to clean, typography-focused slides** — generated images are an enhancement, not
a requirement.

## Build discipline: use the component library

In auto mode you're more likely to rush the build. **Resist the temptation to hard-code
simple boxes when a component exists:**

❌ **Don't:**
```python
dk.box(slide, x, y, w, h, fill=color)
dk.text(slide, x+0.2, y+0.2, w-0.4, h-0.4, content)
```

✅ **Do** — reach for a component that actually exists:
```python
dk.icon_card(slide, x, y, w, h, icon_png, title, body, accent=color)   # icon + title + body
dk.callout(slide, x, y, w, h, label, body)                             # labelled block, auto-grows
dk.spec_card(slide, x, y, w, h, rows, title="...")                     # key/value rows
```
Pre-tested padding, contrast and sizing. **Check the signature in `scripts/deckkit.py` before
you call it** — an invented helper or a guessed keyword fails at build time, and a guessed
*value* (wrong units, wrong scale) fails silently, which is worse.

The catalogue is the component list **inline in `SKILL.md`** plus
`references/design-gallery.md`. There is no `deckkit-component-guide.md`.

## Critic panel: required in auto mode

🔴 **Running the full critic panel is NOT OPTIONAL in auto mode.** It's the only independent
verification that your auto-decisions produced a good deck.

After build + render + lint, dispatch per `references/critic-panel.md` — the panel is
LENS-based, pointed at `agents/critic.md`; there is no `role=content-critic` parameter:
1. Dispatch a critic subagent with the **content lens** (brief: `agents/critic.md`)
2. Dispatch a second with the **design lens**, given the render PNGs + `lint_deck --json`
3. Validate each returned review: `python3 scripts/validate_review.py critic <review.json>`
   — a review failing schema/coverage is **rejected and re-dispatched once**, never acted on
4. Record it as evidence, not as a claim:
   `python3 scripts/validate_review.py critic <review.json> --record <deck-dir>`
5. **If either reports blocker/major issues, fix them** — don't hand off a deck with known
   problems just because the user said "auto"

🔴 **If the host cannot dispatch subagents, say what was lost.** Running the lenses inline is
the author grading themselves — record `critic: inline (no dispatch on this host — not
independent)` rather than reporting a pass. See the capability ledger in
`references/interview-protocol.md`.

The user delegated *choices*, not *quality*. A deck with contrast violations, text walls,
or incoherent rhythm fails regardless of who made those mistakes.

## Summary checklist for auto mode

Before claiming "deck complete" in auto mode, verify:

- ✅ Posted content checkpoint (even if user didn't comment)
- ✅ Posted design checkpoint (even if user didn't comment)  
- ✅ Content plan has source-trace table and digest
- ✅ Design plan has form ledger, rhythm map, signature move, all gates
- ✅ Build script uses deckkit components (not hard-coded boxes)
- ✅ Generated images (if any) have topic-relevant prompts
- ✅ All text-over-image has adequate scrim (contrast ≥ 3:1)
- ✅ Deck rendered to PNG
- ✅ Lint ran (hard errors = 0)
- ✅ Content critic ran and issues addressed
- ✅ Design critic ran and issues addressed
- ✅ Review tier met the derived floor (never auto-downgraded)

If any checkbox is unchecked, the deck is not ready. "Auto mode" is not a waiver for
incomplete work.
