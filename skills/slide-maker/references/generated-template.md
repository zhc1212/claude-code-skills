# Generate a template with an image tool

The user picked Q1's **"generate a template with an image tool."** Instead of building on a
provided template or designing a clean default, you **create a bespoke visual identity with the
image tool** (a styled hero/divider illustration) and then **reproduce it natively** so every
content block fits it. Use it for a *vivid, designed* deck — a product launch, a festival/event,
a brand or culture deck, a playful pitch — where a clean default look isn't enough.

This branch **decides the look up front**, so after it's confirmed you **skip the direction
gate** and any LOOK question — the rest of the interview (purpose, audience, source, language,
and Q4's density + tone, which the visual identity does not decide) still runs normally.

## The construction model (this is the whole idea)
A good generated template is a **cohesive visual SYSTEM**, not one pretty picture — a palette, a
small **motif vocabulary** (the signature shapes/decorations), a type pairing, and **component
treatments** (how a card, a stat, an emphasis band, a title look). It is realised in **two
layers**, and the split is what keeps it editable *and* on-brand:

- **Hero + section-divider slides → a full-bleed GENERATED image.** A rich, styled, **text-free**
  illustration carries the mood; the title and badges sit on top as **native** editable shapes.
  These carry the full-strength imagery (interior pages get only the faint plate). **And bookend the deck** — it OPENS on the hero cover and should CLOSE on a matching **ENDING page** in the same divider-strength imagery, so the deck doesn't simply stop on a faint body slide; the wrap-up sits natively on top (thank-you / recap / call-to-action / contact), the mirror of the cover. The ending page can reuse the divider/hero plate — no new generation needed.
- **Content slides → built NATIVELY to match, on a SHALLOW background — never a flat single
  colour.** The content (cards/chips/bands) is native python-pptx that reuses the template's
  palette, motifs, and component treatments — that's why inserted blocks *fit*. But the slide
  **canvas underneath them is not a plain fill**: every interior page carries a *subtle, low-
  contrast* background so the deck feels designed end-to-end, not "cover is gorgeous, body is
  blank." A flat one-colour content slide next to a lush cover is the #1 tell of a half-finished
  generated template. The shallow background is **faint by design** (it sits *behind* content and
  must never fight the text — see the legibility guardrail), and — **in the general case (and on the
  non-image-tool branches)** — it comes from one of (the image-tool MUST below then *picks* the plate):
  - a **faint native texture** in the palette — a soft two-stop gradient wash, a faint
    `backdrop_motif` field, or a tinted corner/band — the lightest-weight option, fully editable; **or**
  - a **subtle imagery plate** — a dedicated low-contrast, text-free background image generated in
    the same style (placed `picture(fit="cover")`), or the hero re-placed full-bleed under a heavy
    `scrim_overlay` so a soft but **still-visible** ghost of it remains (a ghost you genuinely can't see is the same failure as no plate — see the visibility floor in the legibility guardrails).
  **🔴 MUST for the image-tool template — the interior shallow background is itself a GENERATED image
  plate, not a flat / merely-native fill — and it is TOPICAL.** The chosen style is the **whole deck's**
  identity, not cover decoration: every
  interior/main-content page carries a **dedicated low-contrast, text-free background image generated in
  the same style AND related to the deck's topic/content** (the subtle imagery plate above — a faint
  circuit-and-node field for an AI deck, faint botanicals for a garden brand, never a generic mesh or
  abstract filler that could sit under any deck), so the body reads as *designed* as the cover; a flat — or a
  merely-native, gradient-only — interior under a lush generated cover is the failure to avoid. Apply the
  **SAME plate on every content slide** so they read as one system (a second topical plate variant is
  fine for a long deck's section change); only the cover and dividers get the
  full, vivid imagery. **The plate is a faint DERIVATIVE of the hero itself** — the hero's own signature motif and palette, softened, evenly-toned, low-saturation — **not a generic or unrelated texture** (a stock triangulated mesh, random grain): a plate whose motif differs from the hero reads as a second, unrelated design and quietly breaks the one-system illusion, so 'a plate on every page' is met on paper while the deck stops feeling like one identity. *Carves (audit-scoped) — the MUST yields to:* **(1)** a deliberately **minimal /
  flat** generated style (Swiss · Scandinavian · Brutalist) whose aesthetic *is* near-flat; **(2)** the
  **user explicitly asking for clean / flat / minimal interiors**, or a **brand identity that is itself a
  flat colour field** (honour the request/brand — a faint native texture or the flat brand field is then
  correct); **(3)** a **line-heavy figure slide**, where you **mask / suppress the plate** (the
  motif-suppression rule above). Outside those, generate the plate. *(Outside this image-tool branch — e.g. a "design a clean one" deck — a
  faint native texture is still a fine shallow background; the generated-plate MUST is specific to having
  chosen the image tool.)*
  - **But SUPPRESS the motif on a slide whose content is itself the same visual language** — e.g. a
    **line/grid** shallow background (blueprint grid, hatch) behind a slide whose figure is **dense
    line-work** (a timing diagram, a k-space line stack, a wave/axis plot, a ruled table): the motif and
    the figure blend and muddle each other. Provide a **grid-free variant of the same background** (keep
    the frame/footer chrome so it still reads as one system) or seat the figure on a solid/frosted panel
    that masks the motif. This is the one place "same treatment on every slide" yields — see
    `design-principles.md` "A textured / line / grid background must not compete with line-heavy content."
  - **🔴 MUST — on a generated-template deck the content BLOCKS are FROSTED (semi-transparent),
    NEVER flat opaque.** A *hard rule*, not a skippable default: a generated template's whole point is a
    rich, *designed* background, so a flat **opaque** card reads as "pasted on" and breaks the illusion.
    Every interior page therefore pairs the **shallow background (above)** with **frosted blocks** — the
    two go together, and shipping either a flat-colour content page **or** opaque cards on the generated
    background is the failure to avoid. (Narrow exceptions that may stay OPAQUE: a thumbnail's own image; a deliberately solid emphasis
    band; a panel placed to MASK a line motif under a line-heavy figure (that one MUST be solid, per the
    suppress-motif rule above); a **full-bleed figure / photo that fills the slide** (not a "block" — out
    of scope); and a **deliberately PLAIN / near-flat minimal style** (Swiss · Scandinavian · Brutalist)
    whose interior background is flat by design — there a crisp **opaque** card is correct, matching
    design-principles.md "Block fill must FIT the background". Otherwise cards / panels / chips default
    frosted.)
    **The composite card components default OPAQUE — switch them to their glass variants here:**
    `kpi_card(fill="glass")` (frosted body instead of the white default), `icon_tile(glass=True)`,
    or seat any other component (`dumbbell_board`, `flow_compare`, a stat block) on a `glass_card`
    first and pass `fill`-less content on top. A stock component dropped at its white-canvas default
    onto an interior plate is exactly the "opaque card on generated background" failure above.
    Give every card/panel/chip a **slight transparency** so the background shows through (~30–45%) and it
    belongs to the scene — a low-alpha glass tint of the block colour + a subtle lighter rim
    (`deckkit.glass_card`, or `box(grad=[(0,tint,α),(1,tint,α)])` with **α ≈ 0.55–0.72**), the **same
    treatment deck-wide**, tint/rim **harmonised with the palette** (dark deck → dark glass + a faint
    accent rim; light deck → white glass). **Pick α by how rich/busy the background is** — a busy plate →
    a bit more opaque (higher α) for contrast; a faint shallow wash → more transparent. **Text ≥4.5:1 is
    non-negotiable** — raise α or strengthen the tint over a bright/busy patch (never drop the transparency
    just to pass contrast — adjust α instead). (design-principles.md "Block fill must FIT the background".)

> Don't make every slide a generated image with text baked in — baked text isn't editable, wraps
> badly in other languages, and can't be critiqued/fixed. Images set the mood on heroes/dividers;
> native shapes carry the content.

## Workflow

### 1 — Mini-interview for the visual identity (before generating)
Run a short extra interview *now* — only what the *look* needs (purpose/audience/source come
later in the normal interview):
- **Scenario / topic** — what the deck is for (e.g. "summer music festival annual handbook").
- **Show the candidate styles as a VISUAL HTML preview of REAL generated images — a "style gate"
  (recommended).** Don't make the user choose a style from words alone — and don't frame this gate
  around *colour* (colour variations of one look belong to the flat/clean **direction gate** in
  `collaborative-mode.md`; palette here is a *derived detail*, tailored after the style is chosen).
  This gate is about **STYLE, chosen for the TOPIC + CONTENT**: pick the **3 best-fit named styles for
  what this deck is actually about** from the **Style library** at the end of this file, and make them
  **deliberately DIVERSE** — three different visual *languages* (e.g. Swiss vs Manga vs Glassmorphism;
  Ink-wash vs Blueprint vs Claymorphism), never three moods of one language.
  🔴 **Shortlist by the TOPIC-DOMAIN contest, not by reflex — `references/design-by-topic.md` governs
  the generated branch too** (its parenthetical says so): read the domain → apt styles → **ANTI-PICK**,
  apply the guardrail vetoes and the **CLICHÉ GUARD** (never reflex a neon/HUD sci-fi hero for "AI/tech",
  a gradient-orb mesh for every SaaS, ink-wash for every "Chinese" topic), then let the 3 candidates be
  the apt registers — at least one may be a **bespoke register invented for the subject**
  (`references/bespoke-registers.md`), the image analogue of the clean branch's bespoke direction. And
  the anti-pick applies to the generated **hero art-direction** itself (`image-generation.md` CLICHÉ
  GUARD), not just the style name. **Record the pick as `design_plan.style_pick`** — `<the generated
  register> for <domain> · beat <nearest rival> · anti-pick avoided: <the image cliché>` — the same
  required field every other branch fills (the hand-off gate checks it here too). For each candidate,
  **GENERATE 1 real template image (2 for the front-runner) in that style, on this topic** — a
  text-free hero/cover-grade plate with a calm title zone, exactly what the winner's cover will be —
  then compose **ONE self-contained HTML gallery** (the images beside the file, one `<img>` card per
  style with its name, a one-line "why it fits this topic", and a **Pick** line) and **hand the user
  the single `file://…` link**. The user judges the *actual generated look*, not a native mock of it —
  for an image-driven template, palette-token mockups under-sell every image-native style (manga,
  clay, watercolour, collage) and the choice is only real when they see the imagery. Cost is bounded:
  3–4 images total, and the winner's gate image **is reused as the deck's hero** (no regeneration).
  - *Fallback:* if image generation is unavailable (no tool, no key) or the user wants the fastest
    path, fall back to native token-set mockups via `scripts/archetypes_html.py` — say plainly that
    they show palette/type direction only, and the real imagery lands at the 🔴 hero checkpoint.
  - **The choice prompt MUST offer these as FIRST-CLASS, peer options — not just fallbacks** (present
    them as selectable choices, e.g. via the host's option UI; some users want to *delegate* the look
    and shouldn't have to engage with the picker to do it):
    - **A / B / C — pick one of the shown styles** (the common path: they *see* the candidates and choose).
    - **"Auto — you pick the best-fit and just go"** — an explicit, up-front peer option (NOT only a
      "liked none" escape). When the user takes it (or says "you decide / design it for me"), YOU select
      the best-fit library style from **the topic + content + audience** (brand colours fold in at the
      tailoring step) and **name it back** ("for a summer
      festival I'll go Memphis/pop"), or, for a distinctive scenario, give a richer **mood-led** prompt
      (scenario + energy + palette + "design a cohesive visual identity") instead of a named style — then
      generate and let them react at the hero checkpoint. **If they pick Auto up front, you may SKIP the
      HTML style gate entirely** and go straight to generate → the 🔴 hero checkpoint (don't make a
      delegating user wait on a picker they didn't want).
    - **"D — describe your own / provide a reference"** — synthesize a fresh token-set from their words /
      reference image / brand and **regenerate the HTML** so they still pick from something they can *see*.
  Auto is **not a blind commit**: every path — pick, auto, or own — resolves to a concrete look the user
  reacts to at the 🔴 hero checkpoint, which is the real gate in the default flow (a full per-deck
  "decide everything yourself / just show me the result" directive downgrades it to an FYI — post the
  renders and proceed; see SKILL.md "The per-deck AUTO WAIVER").
- **Vibe / mood (if describing your own)** — the aesthetic in words: energy (calm↔loud), era,
  references. Use this to pick/blend a library style or to author a fresh one.
- **Brand colours / must-haves** — any fixed colours, a logo, words that must appear.
- **Reference material — invite drop-ins.** Explicitly offer: *"drop in any reference images, a
  logo, a mood board, screenshots of a look you like, or a brand guide and I'll steer the
  generation by them."* Use provided references to anchor the style (and, if a logo/photo is
  given, place it natively, not regenerated). If the user frames a dropped-in example as
  **"mimic this"**, first ask Q4's intent question before generating — a Q4 mimic answer lands
  HERE on this branch, with the example as the anchor reference: **Mode A** — its style brief
  (`style-analysis.md`) seeds the token-set and hero prompt directly, steering the generation to
  faithfully clone its look (skip the library pick); **Mode B** — the chosen generated style sets
  palette/mood, and the example's 2–4 borrowed components/structure are recreated in the native
  helpers (the generated identity restyles them).

**Then TAILOR the chosen style to *this* deck before generating** — fold in the topic, the brand
colours, the energy, and anything from the reference materials. The library entry is the *starting
language, not a straitjacket*: customise its palette/motifs to fit, and blending two presets (or a
preset + a reference) is fine — just name what you're combining so the choice is legible to the user.

### 2 — Generate the template image(s)
Generate a **full-bleed, text-free** hero/divider illustration in the chosen style. *(Came through
the real-image style gate? The winner's gate image IS the hero — don't regenerate it; this step then
only adds the divider variant, if wanted, and the 🔴 interior plate below.)*
- **Tooling — auto-detect the source, no API key needed** (build the prompt with
  `scripts/image_prompts.py`; full guidance in `references/image-generation.md`). Use what's present,
  in order: **(1)** native imagegen when the host has it (inside Codex — use the agent tool call
  directly, free, no key); **(2)** else
  the **Codex CLI** `scripts/generate_images_codex.py --orientation landscape` if `codex` is installed
  (Codex/ChatGPT subscription, **no key** — shells `codex exec`, decodes the hosted image from the
  session rollout); **(3)** else, only as a fallback, the OpenAI API `scripts/generate_images_openai.py`
  with `OPENAI_API_KEY` — **metered, and gated: an available key is not consent. Ask before the first
  paid call (🔴 stop, not waived by an auto directive), and if the user declines, fall back to a
  non-generated look rather than spending** (the BILLING GATE in `image-generation.md`).
  **Don't prompt the user to choose or ask for a key when (1) or (2) is
  available — just use it and say which; the ask applies only to the paid rung.** Render at the deck's
  aspect (16:9 → e.g. `1536x864` / `2048x1152`). In Codex's native path, follow its save-path policy:
  generate first, then move/copy the selected output from `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images/...` into
  this deck's folder before referencing it in `style.py` or a build script.
- **Prompt craft:** describe the *style + motif vocabulary + palette*, the subject/scene, **"no
  text, no lettering, no logos"**, and **leave a calm, lower-contrast zone** (a corner/band)
  where the title will sit. Ask for the **signature motifs** explicitly (e.g. "scattered Memphis
  geometric shapes — zigzags, dots, triangles, squiggles, checkerboard — bold black outlines")
  so you can reproduce them natively later.
- **🔴 Title-over-hero legibility — prompting a calm zone is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT; you MUST
  back the text AND verify.** The model often ignores the calm-zone request and runs a decorative
  **frame line / ray / motif right through where the title lands** — and the build-time lint can't see
  it (it only checks text-on-text / off-canvas, never text-on-image-linework). So on EVERY hero/divider
  that carries text: (1) place a **scrim behind the whole text block** — a gradient (or frosted panel)
  strong enough that at the glyphs the effective background is dark/quiet enough for ≥4.5:1 (a corner
  scrim reaching **α ≈ 0.55–0.85** over light text is typical; a token 0.2 wash is not enough over a
  busy plate); (2) **in the render, look specifically at the title**: no image line/edge/motif crosses
  the glyphs, and every run (including a low-contrast **eyebrow/kicker** in gold/tint) clears the
  contrast floor — if a line still cuts the text or the eyebrow washes out, strengthen the scrim,
  move the text to a genuinely empty region, or lighten the run. Treat a title fighting the image's
  linework as a real defect, exactly like an overflow.
  **🔴 A translucent scrim DIMS a bright line but does NOT erase it** — a gold/teal Deco frame-line or
  a bright edge stays visible through a 0.5–0.7 wash and keeps cutting the glyphs. When the hero
  carries **framing / linework / high-detail exactly where the title lands** (common with Deco /
  bordered / ornamented styles), escalate from a scrim to a **near-opaque title panel** (a solid or
  α ≥ 0.88 block — a lower-third band or a corner card **anchored to and filling to the canvas edge**,
  never bleeding off-canvas, which the strict lint rejects) that fully COVERS the linework; verify the
  covered area is clean. And keep an **unmistakable gap between the title and its subtitle** (the rule/
  subtitle is a separate block, not touching the big title's baseline) — cramped title/subtitle
  spacing reads as an error even when nothing technically overlaps.
- Generate **1–2 plates**: a **hero** (cover) and, if the look differs, a **divider** variant.
- **Generate the interior shallow-background plate too — 🔴 MUST (see the construction model).**
  Alongside the hero, generate **one extra low-contrast background plate**: a **text-free, faint,
  evenly-toned, TOPIC-RELATED** version of the style (calm, low-saturation, no strong focal point,
  generous negative
  space) made to sit *behind* content on **every interior page**. Name the deck's own subject motifs
  in the prompt — the topical requirement from the construction model, not a generic texture — while
  prompting explicitly for low contrast
  and even tone ("soft, faded, low-contrast background of scattered faint <topic motifs — e.g.
  circuit nodes / botanical leaves / musical staves>, lots of calm negative space in the
  centre, no focal subject, no text") so dark text stays readable on top with only a **light scrim**.
  *Carve:* a deliberately **minimal / flat** generated style (Swiss · Scandinavian · Brutalist) may skip
  the plate and use a faint native texture instead — its aesthetic is near-flat by design.
- Keep assets in `~/Downloads/<deck>/assets/generated/`. Never leave a generated template
  image referenced only from Codex's default generated-images cache or an OS temp folder.

### 3 — Derive a matching `style.py` (treat the image as a style example)
Study the generated image the way you'd study a provided style example
(`references/style-analysis.md`) and encode it so native content matches:
- **Palette — extract it from the image** so colours are coherent:
  resolve the image path relative to the deck/build script, then call
  `BASE = deckkit.palette_from_image(ROOT / "assets/generated/hero.png", 6)`; set the style's
  base/ink and `ACCENTS` from it. (This is the bridge that makes native blocks fit the
  generated look.) Avoid bare `"assets/..."` paths that depend on the shell's current directory.
- **Motif vocabulary** — write 3–5 tiny native helpers for the signature shapes (e.g.
  `zigzag()`, `dot()`, `triangle()`, `squiggle()`), drawn with `deckkit` autoshapes in the
  palette, with the same outline weight. **Sprinkle them sparingly** as accents near content —
  never over the text.
- **Component treatments — GEOMETRY derived from the image, not defaulted.** Define the template's
  card / stat / emphasis-band / chip / title-chrome look as helpers, and set their geometry by
  READING four properties off the generated image:
  (1) **outline weight** — comic/hand-drawn → bold 2–3pt ink-coloured outlines on cards and chips;
  blueprint/technical → hairlines, some dashed; painterly → no outlines, shape by fill;
  (2) **corner language** — comic/soft-organic → rounded; pixel/brutalist → square, zero radius;
  one radius scale across ALL components (mixed corner languages are an existing critic flag);
  (3) **shadow/depth** — comic → hard offset shadows (`offset_shadow`, zero blur); soft-organic →
  diffuse or none; flat/minimal → none;
  (4) **fill flatness** — comic/pixel → flat fills, no gradients; painterly → soft tints; frosted
  glass only where imagery sits underneath.
  A COMIC identity, concretely: 2.5pt ink outlines + rounded corners + hard offset shadows + flat
  palette fills + speech-bubble/burst motif helpers sharing the same outline weight. **Echo, don't
  cosplay:** the plates carry the heavy style; components pick up the palette + these four
  properties — never painted mimicry of the artwork — and the floors never bend to style
  (contrast ≥4.5:1, text always native/editable, legibility before flavour). Component outlines/shadows are part of the CONTENT surface
  language, not chrome — the chrome budget still governs title furniture, rules and footers at
  every register.
- **A `content_bg(slide)` helper — the shallow interior background, called FIRST on every content
  slide.** This is what stops content pages being flat. Per the 🔴 MUST it places the **GENERATED
  interior plate**: `deckkit.picture(bg_plate, fit="cover")` then a **light scrim** (`scrim_overlay`, or
  a white low-alpha `box`) to mute it to a shallow wash. Encode it ONCE so it's identical on every slide;
  keep it *low-contrast by construction* and verify body text clears 4.5:1 on top. *(Minimal/flat-style
  carve only — when no plate was generated: a faint two-stop gradient, or a faint
  `deckkit.backdrop_motif(color=<very light palette tint>)`, instead.)*
- **A `brand(slide)` helper for the logo (only if the deck is about a company/institution/product).**
  Wrap `deckkit.logo(slide, LOGO_PATH, corner=..., h=...)` so the real logo lands in the SAME spot
  on every slide. Decide the corner once to fit the template (top-right is the usual choice; move it
  if the title chrome or motifs occupy that corner) and keep it consistent. On a vivid hero, add a
  small scrim/light plate behind the logo so it stays legible.
- **Type register — derive it from the image's CHARACTER, never choose it independently.** A
  gorgeous plate with an off-register default face on top is the type-level version of the
  pasted-on card. Map the identity family to a register, then pick portable faces inside it
  (portability + CJK pairing: `references/multilingual.md`, `references/font-guidance.md` — a
  style-matched face must be install-safe or get a register-adjacent system fallback, flagged at
  hand-off):

  | Identity family | Latin register | CJK pairing note |
  |---|---|---|
  | Comic / hand-drawn / doodle | rounded humanist or comic-adjacent display (Comic Neue if installed → Trebuchet MS/Verdana fallback) | a rounded gothic (yuanti-class) face if installed → Hiragino Sans GB fallback; never a brush Kai (reads formal, not playful) |
  | Blueprint / technical / terminal | technical sans + mono labels (Consolas/Menlo class) | Hiragino Sans GB · mono digits |
  | Ink-wash / brush / Eastern | serif Latin (Georgia class) | Kai/Song per `east-asian-aesthetic.md`; lining digits beside CJK |
  | Pixel / retro / arcade | geometric sans or mono, square terminals | Hiragino Sans GB; avoid rounded faces |
  | Painterly / organic / botanical | humanist serif or light humanist sans | Songti or Hiragino by warmth |
  | Editorial / magazine / collage | high-contrast serif display + grotesque body | Songti display + Hiragino body |
  | Corporate-clean / minimal | neo-grotesque (Helvetica Neue class) | Hiragino Sans GB |
  | Luxury / museum | serif display, generous tracking | Songti; thin rules |

  An identity OUTSIDE these families (cinematic-photoreal, memphis/pop, collage…) follows the
  same logic, not a dead-end: read the letterform character the image itself implies (what type
  would a poster in this world use?), pick the nearest register, and record the reasoning in the
  contract's type line — the table is a map, not a cage. On a CJK-only deck the Latin column
  still governs numerals and any Latin fragments.

  Set `deckkit.FONT`/`EAFONT` from the chosen pair; define `title_bar`/`footer` to the template's
  chrome in the same register.
- Put all of this in the deck's `style.py` (copy `references/examples/style_example.py` as the
  starting shape). 🔴 **The `geometry:` and `surface:` lines below are CARRIED BY CODE, not by
  intention** — `deckkit.set_geometry(radius=…, rule_w=…)` and `deckkit.set_ground(<bg>)`, both
  in the scaffold. `radius=0` squares every box-based component and `node()`, which is the only
  way a hard-edged generated identity reaches the library; `rule_w` scales card borders,
  dividers and node outlines; `set_ground` makes `add_slide()` paint the derived ground, so a
  dark identity is dark from slide one rather than from wherever a rectangle got drawn. This
  branch used to name `geometry:` in a contract and have no mechanism behind it: the scaffold
  carried colour and type only, so a generated identity propagated two of its four lines and
  every card, node and outline in the deck kept the library's stock shape. A contract with no
  carrier is the same defect the preset path had, one branch over.
  **Record `look_source: "generated"` in the Design plan too** — `check_style_applied.py` uses it
  to tell this branch apart from the preset path, since the topic contest runs here as well and
  a generated pick legitimately names the preset that art-directed the hero.
  **And record the four-line IDENTITY-PROPAGATION CONTRACT in the Design plan**:
  `palette: extracted from hero` · `type: <register — faces + CJK pair>` · `geometry:
  <outline/corner/shadow/fill read off the image>` · `surface: <frosted / tint / outlined>`. These
  four lines accompany the hero + sample-content renders at the 🔴 hero checkpoint (or its
  auto-waiver FYI), so the user approves the whole SYSTEM — not just the pictures — and the critic
  judges the built deck against them.

### 4 — Render a sample and get feedback (hard gate)
Build **two** slides — the **cover** (hero image + native title/badges) and **one real content
slide** (native, using the derived components: a few cards + an emphasis band + motifs) — render
them, and show both. The content slide is essential: it proves the blocks actually fit.
> **🔴 CHECKPOINT** — show the generated template (hero + a sample content slide) and get the
> user's OK. Iterate on their feedback until they confirm. Only then proceed.
> *(Under a full per-deck auto directive this stop is posted as an FYI and you proceed.)*

**Match the FIX to what they asked to change — don't reflexively recolor:**
- **A small palette / contrast tweak** ("warmer accent", "lighter background", "less saturated", "bigger
  title zone") → adjust `style.py` (and re-place natively); **no regeneration needed**.
- **A change of ATMOSPHERE / mood / style / feel** ("make it more energetic / calmer / darker / more
  futuristic / more organic / more playful / more premium / more clinical") → **RE-GENERATE the hero —
  do not just change the colour.** A mood lives in the **imagery itself** — its *subject, composition,
  lighting, texture, and motifs* — not only the palette. Rewrite the image prompt so **all** of those
  shift to embody the new atmosphere (e.g. *more energetic* → dynamic diagonal composition, bold forms,
  vivid directional light; *calmer* → sparse, soft, generous negative space; *more organic* → natural
  materials and hand-made texture instead of hard geometry), generate a fresh plate, then **re-derive
  `style.py` from the new image** so the native blocks match. Recoloring the old plate leaves its
  original mood baked into the picture, and the hero then fights the feeling the user asked for. If it's
  unclear whether they mean a tweak or a new atmosphere, ask in one line before spending a generation.

### 5 — Continue the interview, run Step 2 (design plan + 🔴 design checkpoint), then build
- The look is decided → **skip the direction gate** and any LOOK question; the rest of the
  normal interview still runs — purpose & audience & time, source material, language, AND Q4's
  density (text-per-point) and tone: those are content/register choices a generated visual
  identity does not decide (density stays an ALWAYS-surfaced choice per SKILL.md Q4).
- **Then run SKILL.md Step 2 IN FULL — the design plan + 🔴 DESIGN CHECKPOINT. The hero checkpoint
  (§4 above) is NOT the design checkpoint: it confirmed the LOOK (the four-line identity contract),
  not the per-slide DESIGN.** SKILL.md treats the two as *distinct* stops — the per-deck auto-waiver
  names "the design checkpoint" AND "the Q1=d hero checkpoint" separately — so skipping Step 2 here
  ships a deck whose layout, rhythm, and forms were never planned or reviewed (only the imagery was).
  The generated identity **FEEDS** the plan — palette / motif / surface / type are its *inputs*,
  recorded as the four-line IDENTITY-PROPAGATION CONTRACT (§3) — it does **not** replace it. Produce
  the full design plan (per-slide **form ledger** + **deck rhythm** map + **signature move** under a
  `boldness` dial + the **3 design musts** builds/icons/formats + **semantic colour** + **density** +
  **logo / motif** line) and post the compact 🔴 DESIGN CHECKPOINT artifact
  (`references/checkpoint-convention.md` spec) **with its required `style gate:` line** — a branch-(d)
  design checkpoint with no gate line is NOT READY. Record it in `.deck-gates.json` as `design_plan` +
  `design_plan.checkpoint` (`{"mode": "approved"|"auto", "record": …}`). **Only after it — approval,
  or its FYI under a per-deck auto directive — do you build.** This is enforced, not just asked:
  `render_deck.py` REFUSES a full render until the design plan + checkpoint are recorded (a `--slides`
  probe stays exempt), so the plan cannot be reconstructed post-hoc at hand-off. On this branch the
  plan's protagonists still sit on the one frosted/plate system (the form-family diversity gate and
  architecture-rotation rule apply fully — don't let every slide become one panel), and Step 2's
  material probe is satisfied by §4's already-rendered sample content slide.
- **Build (step 4 of SKILL.md):**
  - **Cover, section dividers, and the closing / ending page** → the generated image full-bleed (`picture(..., fit="cover")`),
    with the **title and badges native on top**, placed in the image's calm zone (add a soft
    scrim/plate behind the title if the area under it is busy, so contrast stays ≥ 4.5:1).
  - **Content slides** → built **natively** in `style.py`, in this order: **(1)** `content_bg(slide)`
    first so the page has its shallow background (never a flat single colour); **(2)** the template's
    cards/bands/chips/motifs for the content; **(3)** `brand(slide)` last (if it's a
    company/institution/product deck) so the logo sits on top of everything. Reuse the source's real
    figures/tables as always — framed to sit on the template (a thin card/plate behind a figure helps
    it sit on a textured background).
  - **The logo also goes on the cover and dividers** (placed natively over the imagery, with a scrim
    if needed) so the brand is present on every page, including the end pages.
  - Keep the craft rules (one idea/slide, whole figures, contrast, suitable spacing, balanced
    blocks). Then the normal **render + critic loop** — the critic judges whether content
    genuinely fits the template (palette, motifs, components consistent), whether **every interior
    page carries the shallow background** (none left flat), whether the **logo is present and
    consistently placed** where the deck calls for one, and that everything stays legible.
- **Save the confirmed template to the registry** (`<root>/<name>/`, where `<root>` is what
  `python3 scripts/registry.py` reports as the write target — Claude/Codex root if one exists,
  host-neutral `~/.slide-maker/slide-templates/` on every other runtime): the `style.py`, the
  generated `assets/`, and a `profile.md` — so it's a reusable choice next time (it shows up
  under Q1's registered templates). **Under a per-deck auto directive the hero checkpoint was an
  FYI, not a confirmation — defer the save to Step 6's save-this-look offer (explicit yes
  required); only a user-confirmed hero checkpoint earns the automatic save** (never an
  un-consented registry write).

## Legibility & fidelity guardrails (busy styles fight text)
- **Text-free images, native text on top** — never bake slide copy, numbers, labels, or logos
  into the generated plate (the deck's standing rule). *One narrow, opt-in exception:* a purely
  **decorative hero WORDMARK** baked into the cover image **only if the user explicitly asks** for
  that exact stylised-lettering look — and even then, every other piece of text stays native.
- **Contrast on a busy background** — a vivid hero will wreck a thin title. Put the title in the
  image's **calm zone**, or behind a **solid / translucent plate** (a rounded box in a palette
  colour), and check `contrast_ratio ≥ 4.5`.
- **Don't let motifs crowd content** — decorations are *accents in the margins/corners*, not a
  layer over the words. If a motif overlaps text, move or drop it.
- **Consistency across slides** — same palette, same motif set, same component treatments, the
  **same shallow background**, and the **same logo placement** on every slide. A one-off card style,
  a stray colour, a flat content page among textured ones, or a logo that jumps corners breaks the
  "template" illusion faster than anything; the critic should flag it.
- **Rhythm on this branch comes from IMAGERY STRENGTH, never a foreign canvas.** The generic
  "vary the canvas value on at least one beat" pressure (FLAT RHYTHM lint; rhythm-map guidance)
  does NOT license flipping one mid-deck slide to a different background colour — on a
  generated-identity deck, a lone flipped canvas abandons the plate and reads as an *error*, not
  a rhythm event (users call it out immediately). Make the beats by varying how strongly the
  generated imagery shows: faint plate on working slides ↔ full-strength hero imagery on the
  cover, dividers, and the closer. If you genuinely want a canvas value change, it must RECUR as
  a family (all section dividers dark, or dark bookends) — never exactly one interior slide
  (`ONE-OFF CANVAS FLIP` in lint_deck.py enforces this deterministically). Answer FLAT RHYTHM
  with the register exception line, not with a one-off flip.
- **Frosted blocks are a legibility TOOL, not the page format.** The frosted-panel treatment exists
  so text stays readable where the plate is busy — it is NOT an instruction to panel everything.
  On a calm, even plate, big type, hero numbers, chips, and diagrams can (and on ~1/3 of content
  slides SHOULD) sit directly on the canvas; reserve panels for dense mixed content. A deck where
  every element lives in a panel plus a bottom strip on every page reads as one template stamped
  nine times — the architecture-rotation rule (slide-design §4) applies fully on this branch.
- **Icons belong on this branch too** — the icon MUST (self-verify (g)) is not suspended by a
  generated identity: fetch one family (`scripts/icons.py`), recolor to the deck palette, and use
  glass/tile treatments so the glyphs sit inside the same frosted system as the panels.
- **The shallow background must stay BEHIND the content** — it's atmosphere, not a competing layer.
  If it darkens or busies the area under text, mute it harder (lighter tint, stronger scrim, fewer
  motifs); body text must clear 4.5:1 against whatever the background leaves under it. A subtle
  background that forces every text block onto its own opaque card has been made too strong. **But there is a FLOOR as well: the plate must stay SUBTLY VISIBLE** — a viewer should be able to *see* the body page is textured, not have to guess. Muting is one-directional pressure, so it's easy to over-scrim the plate into a flat near-white field that satisfies 'a plate on every page' in code yet reads as absent — the same failure as no plate at all. If you can't tell the plate is there at a glance, the scrim is too heavy: lift it until the hero's motif is faintly but genuinely perceptible, and recover text contrast with the frosted blocks rather than by erasing the plate.
- **Logo = the REAL mark, present where it belongs** — for a company/institution/product deck the
  logo appears on every page; when found, use the real asset **untouched** (image-generation.md's
  hierarchy), never a faked or recolored one; not found → a clean typographic wordmark flagged as a
  designer's stand-in (never a literal "logo here" string in a shipped deck). Either way the DESIGN
  checkpoint's `logo plan:` line carries its evidence token per the slide-design LOGO PRINCIPLE.
- **Generated real things must be right** — if the hero depicts real objects/places, the
  size/proportion/count/colour must be factually correct (the image-generation fidelity rule).
  Identity plates (hero / dividers / interior plate) are the REFERENT RULE's sanctioned carve — a
  place-anchored deck renders the real place as DECLARED STYLIZED ART in the chosen style, never as
  fake photography; the factual-rightness rule (size/proportion/count/colour) still applies to the
  stylized rendering.

## Checklist
- [ ] Mini-interview done (scenario; style offered as a choice — **best-fit library styles** +
      describe-own + reference drop-ins + **"let the image tool pick" (auto)**; brand colours).
- [ ] A style **chosen and tailored** to the scenario — a picked library style, an auto-picked one
      (named back to the user), or a fresh look from a reference — palette/motifs customised, not raw.
- [ ] Hero (and divider) generated **text-free**, in-style, with a **calm zone** for the title — **plus
      the 🔴 MUST interior shallow-background plate** (low-contrast, even-toned, **topic-related** — the
      deck's own subject motifs, never generic texture; skipped only for a
      deliberately minimal/flat style).
- [ ] **🔴 FUSION gate — every generated image is BOTH on-style AND on-topic (both, not either):** looking
      at the rendered hero/divider/plate, (1) the **chosen style register is unmistakable** — its palette,
      motif vocabulary, and treatment are the ones named at the style gate, not a drifted generic look;
      **and** (2) the image **depicts THIS deck's subject** — a stranger could name the topic from the
      picture (an AI deck shows compute/networks/models, a garden brand shows botanicals), never
      interchangeable filler (abstract mesh, random gradient, stock swoosh) that would sit under any deck.
      An image that is beautifully on-style but topically generic **fails** — regenerate with the deck's
      own subject motifs folded into the prompt (the REFERENT RULE, `image-generation.md`). This is the
      user's requirement: a generated image must carry the style AND be strongly tied to the topic.
- [ ] `style.py` derived: palette **extracted from the image**, motif helpers, component helpers,
      fonts/chrome, a **`content_bg(slide)`** for the shallow interior background, and a
      **`brand(slide)`** logo helper if the deck is about a company/institution/product.
- [ ] Sample **cover + content slide** rendered and **confirmed by the user** (🔴 checkpoint).
- [ ] Direction gate **skipped**; rest of the interview (incl. density/tone) completed.
- [ ] **SKILL.md Step 2 run IN FULL** — the design plan (form ledger · rhythm · signature move ·
      3 musts · semantic colour · density · logo/motif) posted as the 🔴 DESIGN CHECKPOINT **with its
      `style gate:` line**, and approved (or FYI'd under an auto directive) **before building**. The
      hero checkpoint (§4) is the LOOK gate, NOT this. (`render_deck.py` refuses the full render until
      `design_plan` + `design_plan.checkpoint` are recorded.)
- [ ] Built: dividers use the image; content is native and **on-system** with the **GENERATED shallow-
      background plate on every interior page** (🔴 MUST — no flat single-colour or merely-gradient
      interior, except a deliberately minimal/flat style) + frosted blocks; the **real logo present and
      consistently placed** on every page if it's a company/institution/product deck; figures framed
      to sit on the template; legibility ≥ 4.5:1 everywhere.
- [ ] Where content names tools/entities/categories, a **palette-recolored icon family** is placed (`scripts/icons.py`; glass/tile treatments on-system) — or the one-clause waiver is recorded.
- [ ] **Architecture rotates** — takeaway slot varies (no bottom strip on every page) and ≥1/3 of protagonists sit direct-on-canvas on a calm plate.
- [ ] The interior plate is a **faint DERIVATIVE of the hero** (same motif/palette, not a generic texture) and stays **subtly visible** on every body page — not scrimmed into a flat near-white field.
- [ ] A **closing / ending page bookends the cover** — full-strength divider-style imagery with a native wrap-up (thank-you / recap / CTA / contact), so the deck doesn't stop on a body slide.
- [ ] Template **saved to the registry** for reuse.

## Style library — well-known starting styles (seed, then tailor)
Proven visual languages to seed the generation from — pick the **3 best-fit for the TOPIC + CONTENT,
deliberately diverse** (three different visual languages, never three moods of one),
offer them as options (+ "describe your own" / "I'll provide a reference"), then **tailor** the
pick (palette, energy, brand colours) before generating. Each entry gives the *palette* /
*motifs* / *type* you'll both put in the image prompt **and** encode in the native `style.py`
(so content matches). Blend two when it fits; add new ones as you discover them.
