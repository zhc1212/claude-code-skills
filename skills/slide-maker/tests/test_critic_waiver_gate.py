# signal count is a bad gate: a 6-slide template-locked status update with ZERO hard findings
# already reaches 3 families, a 9-card 小红书 carousel built exactly to canvas-formats.md's DNA
# reaches 7, an appendix-heavy defense deck reaches 5. Every one is a deck the skill tells you to
# build, so the scope is three deterministic properties (body_n>=8, landscape, not surface) rather
# than a taxonomy of registers — and the threshold is >=4 DISTINCT codes with >=1 structural.
# The false-positive direction matters more than the true-positive one here: a blocking gate that
# fires on a good deck is worse than no gate ("a report that is always wrong is a report everyone
# learns to ignore" — ci.yml).
