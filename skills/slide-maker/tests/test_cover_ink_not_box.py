"""The cover axis must read where the GLYPHS are, not where the text BOX is.

🔴 MEASURED. `check_direction_applied` scored the title block as `sh.left + sh.width/2`. A
full-width, left-aligned title box centres at exactly 50% of the canvas while every glyph hugs the
left margin — so a textbook LOW-LEFT cover was flagged as "centred" on a real deck (0.90in left,
11.53in wide, `job-hunt` flush left → 50.0%). The same line fails the OTHER way too: a genuinely
CENTRED cover whose narrow box sits off to one side scores off-centre and passes. One arithmetic
slip, a false positive and a false negative.

This file pins BOTH directions, because a fix verified only on the case that motivated it is how
the mirror-image bug survives. `deckkit._ink_rect` is the measurement — it accounts for the
frame's margins, measured wraps, the vertical anchor and the paragraph alignment.
