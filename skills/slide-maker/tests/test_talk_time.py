"""The interview asks for the time budget; until `check_talk_time.py` nothing compared the deck to it.

Ending on time is the one thing every audience notices, and for a conference talk it is enforced by
a chair with a microphone. The budget was collected in the interview ("for a talk, give me the time
budget and I will confirm the slide count") and, measured by grep before this suite, no file in the
repo mentioned words per minute, a per-slide minute budget, or a duration of any kind. This is the
repo's recurring shape: a rule that lives in prose and is measured nowhere.

What is pinned here is the JUDGEMENT, not the arithmetic alone:
  * the estimate is a BAND, because delivery pace is someone else's and a single number is a lie;
  * only the SPEAKER NOTES count — on-slide text is not spoken by a presenter doing it right, and
    counting both would punish the decks that follow this skill's own rule;
  * a missing budget and a deck with notes on a third of its slides are NOT CHECKED, out loud —
    an estimate of part of a talk wearing the clothes of a whole one is worse than no estimate.
