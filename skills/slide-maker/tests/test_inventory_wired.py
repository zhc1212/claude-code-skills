"""The file inventory must stay complete, and the guard must be a DETECTOR.

`references/file-inventory.md` is the lookup SKILL.md routes agents to by name. A capability
missing from it is one an agent cannot find — and the cost falls hardest on runtimes with nothing
else to consult, which is exactly the "non-Claude agents can use this" case.

This suite exists because of a defect measured in `check_inventory.py`'s own docstring: 11 of 77
scripts and 11 of 39 references were absent, and nothing reported it. A guard that only ever prints
green is the same failure one level up, so most of what follows is an attack on the guard itself.
