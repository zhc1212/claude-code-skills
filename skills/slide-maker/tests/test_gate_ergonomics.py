"""Six defects found by RUNNING the skill end to end on a real deck, not by reading it.

The build that produced them: a 15-slide presented deck, direction gate, bespoke register,
sourced + generated imagery. Everything here is a measurement from that run.

  * **six consecutive `--gate-check` round-trips**, each naming exactly ONE `design_plan` field —
    `boldness` in the wrong dial format, `signature_proof`, `material_probe`, `concept` in the
    wrong shape, `type_scale.body` under the floor, `form_reach`. The section-abort is a
    deliberate, tested contract ("its later checks read values the earlier one validated") and it
    stays; what was missing is somewhere to learn the SHAPES before spending a round-trip on each.
    `deck_gates.py` is that: five of those six are now one pass.
  * **`directions_diversity.py` is a real detector nothing required anyone to run.** On that
    build's first direction set it reports `TOO SIMILAR Brutalist vs Swiss (palette 37.9)` — which
    the author caught by eye — AND `NO BESPOKE DIRECTION`, which the author did not catch at all:
    the "bespoke" candidate carried colours and a skeleton but no `cover_motif`, so the user chose
    from three presets and a colourway. The arc competition is re-scored at hand-off; the design
    competition was a sentence somebody typed.
  * **`presets.apply("terminal")` set Consolas, which macOS does not have** — every measurement in
    a fixed-width register computed in a proportional substitute. `_font_substituted` was one call
    away.
  * **`RULE_THROUGH_TEXT` had no declaration**, so a STRIKE-THROUGH — a rule crossing its own text,
    which is what the mark means — could not be built. Its two siblings both have one.
  * **the builds choice was carried by memory**: the user opted out of appear-builds and `--static`
    still had to be retyped on every lint run or `NO BUILDS` fired on a deck that is static by
    their decision.
