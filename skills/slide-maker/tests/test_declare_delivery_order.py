"""`declare_delivery` hashes the file on disk, so calling it before the save is a silent trap.

🔴 MEASURED, on a real 12-page build. The docstring said "call it beside the save"; `beside` reads
as either side, and called BEFORE `prs.save(...)` it records no hash at all on a first build and
the PREVIOUS build's hash on every rebuild. Every later `--gate-check` then reported

    🔴 EDITED SINCE BUILD: … Somebody saved over it — Reconcile first: scripts/extract_deck.py

on a file nobody had touched, and the message named the ONE cause it could not know while staying
silent about the mechanical one that was actually true. That is a round-trip and a wrong diagnosis
for any agent that writes the call in the order the docstring allowed.

Three things are pinned here: the call FAILS LOUDLY when the deck does not exist yet, a correct
build records a hash that MATCHES, and the mismatch message DIAGNOSES the ordering from the build
script instead of blaming a person.
