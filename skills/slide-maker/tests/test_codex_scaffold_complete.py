"""Every field the Codex gate REQUIRES must appear in the template that gate itself writes.

🔴 MEASURED. A Codex run filled `--init`'s scaffold end to end, supplied a real deck and a clean
lint, and was still BLOCKED by `interview.picks is missing` and `design.composition is missing` —
two of 43 errors, for fields that had never appeared in the template it was given. Both gates had
bound them on BOTH runtimes for a while; only the shared path's `deck_gates.py --init` showed
them, so the rule existed and the Codex agent had no way to discover it. That is this repo's
recorded lesson in a new place: a capability that does not reach the example scaffold has not been
added for the runtime that reads the scaffold.

This asserts the property rather than the two instances: fill the scaffold with plausible values,
run the real gate, and fail if any error names a field the scaffold never mentioned.
