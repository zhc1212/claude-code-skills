"""On a 中文 deck the ruler was short by 46%, and every geometry check used it.

`_natural_width_in` was never wrong — hand it a face that covers CJK and it is exact. What was
wrong was the FACE handed to it. `_ink_rect` resolved a run's face with `run.font.name`, and
python-pptx's `font.name` reads `<a:latin>`; CJK glyphs render from `<a:ea>`, where `set_font` /
`_apply_ea` put the East-Asian face. Measured on one real subtitle at 13pt (27 full-width glyphs,
true width 4.8750in):

    Hiragino Sans GB   4.8750in   exact
    Songti SC          4.8750in   exact
    Helvetica Neue     2.6181in   54% — what every check was actually using

That under-measurement reaches TEXT_OVERLAP, OFF_CANVAS, ESCAPES_CARD, FOOTER and every geometry
decision built on ink rectangles, i.e. essentially all of this file's geometry on a Chinese deck.
Its signature in practice is the worst kind: a page collides after a generous-looking margin was
left, and nudging coordinates gives feedback that does not match intuition — so the operator
blames their own arithmetic rather than the ruler.

The resolution goes through `_inherited_ea`, not through a second width model and not through a
`_is_wide` branch: a supplied CJK template normally sets the face one level up (paragraph
`defRPr`, the shape's `lstStyle`), and that is the same chain `retrofit_ea` and `CJK_NO_EA`
already walk — so all three agree by construction rather than by coincidence.
