"""A written-reason floor must mean the same amount of INFORMATION in every language.

`len()` counts codepoints, so `len(reason) < 12` is "12 letters" in English and about 24 letters'
worth in Chinese. Measured on a real Chinese deck built with this skill: `audience_brief` rejected
「敢不敢把求职材料交给它」 (11 codepoints, width 22) while a 12-letter English phrase carrying a
third as much passed. `written_reason.reason_width` had shipped months earlier; four modules
simply never reached for it — two of them written the same day as a module that used it
correctly. Knowing the rule did not make anyone apply it, so the guard is the deliverable.

This file covers what `check_reason_width.py --list` cannot: that the guard DETECTS the form the
bug is actually written in, that it does not fire on correct code, and that every floor in the
repo now behaves identically in both scripts.
