"""The surface kits: do they build the REGISTER, obey it, and stay out of the content's way.

The measurement that motivated the module: one identical page through all 18 presets rendered as
18 colourways of one page. These tests hold the three properties that stop the kits from being
the same thing with more code — the pages must actually DIFFER, each must obey its own register's
prohibitions, and the content rect a kit hands back must be usable (nothing loud painted into it).
That last one is not theoretical: the first render put a memphis triangle through a card corner and
a bauhaus disc through the third card, under a docstring promising it could not happen.
