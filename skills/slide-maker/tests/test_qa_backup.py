"""A deck that cannot JUMP has no backup slides — only slides nobody will reach.

Parking prepared answers after the close is ordinary practice in every room this skill builds for.
It works only if the speaker can jump to one while the room watches, and get back. Measured before
this suite: `grep -rn hlinkClick scripts/` found the string only in `_EA_FOLLOWERS`, a constant listing
XML element order, and `click_action` appeared nowhere — the library could not make a deck jump at all, so every "backup
slide" it ever built was reachable only by arrowing past everything in between.

So two things are pinned here, and the second is the one that binds:
  * the COMPONENTS — `link` (shape -> slide, shape/run -> URL, scheme-guarded), `agenda`
    (a contents page that is also a jump table), `back_link` (the other half of a jump);
  * the GATE — `content.qa` names the question and the slide that answers it, and the BUILT file
    is checked for a real slide action pointing there. Anticipating questions stays a practice,
    not a law: nothing recorded is NOT CHECKED, out loud.

Jumps are verified after SAVE AND REOPEN, never on the in-memory object: a relationship that
python-pptx holds and does not serialise would pass any check made before the file is written.
