"""Two looks made into artifacts: the actor's render self-check (#1) and the critic record (#2).

WHY (user directive). The gate set measures whether the design WORK happened; the two remaining
"look at it" steps were prose with no backstop:

  #1 RENDER SELF-CHECK — Step 5 tells the coordinator to read every slide PNG and record a one-line
     verdict per slide ("a slide with no line was not checked"). The cheap actor-side look that
     catches an overflow / wrong number BEFORE a critic round is spent had no trace, so it was the
     easiest step to skip silently. Now: `render_selfcheck.slides`, one verdict per slide.

  #2 CRITIC RECORD — a consent used to pass as a bare `{"verdict":"consent","rounds":N}`, labelled
     SELF-REPORTED. That is the last self-cert hole: a skipped loop writes the identical JSON to a
     real one. Consent now REQUIRES the recorded review artifact (path + sha256, coverage bound to
     the deck). The escape is the honest WAIVER (no-dispatch-on-host), not a weaker consent.

Both hold on BOTH gate paths (render_deck + codex_delivery_gate) — they have drifted before. These
tests write .deck-gates.json DIRECTLY (not through fit_content, which auto-supplies both) so the
FAILURE paths are actually exercised.
