"""A written reason is judged by how much it SAYS, not by which language it says it in.

WHY. Every "record a written reason" floor in this skill was `len(text) < N` — a count of
codepoints — which made the bar depend on the writing system:

    "看过了，不用再审"                       8 codepoints → refused by a floor of 12
    "这个盒子是模板固定槽位，只能改常数"       17 codepoints → refused by a floor of 20
    "the box is a fixed template slot"     32 codepoints → accepted

The Chinese strings say more and were refused for using fewer characters. On a Chinese deck —
which is most of the decks this skill actually builds — that is a gate nobody can satisfy
honestly, and the only way past a gate you cannot satisfy is padding it with words nobody means.
That destroys the one property these reasons exist to have.

`written_reason.reason_width` counts an East-Asian wide/fullwidth character as 2. Both directions
are asserted, because a fix that quietly lowered the bar for everyone would be worse than the bug:
CJK reasons of real substance now pass, short ones (in ANY language) still do not, and every ASCII
floor keeps its behaviour exactly.
