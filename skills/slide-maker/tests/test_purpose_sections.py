"""A deck's GENRE declares content it is not finished without — and that is now checked.

`design-by-purpose.md` carried nine purpose recipes and nothing consumed them: measured by grep,
every per-purpose rule there was advisory by construction. Four genres with the most rigid
conventions were absent from the list entirely, and three of those are among the most common decks
an academic makes.

The mechanism is `formats.py` / `check_surface.py` generalised from SURFACES to GENRES. This suite
pins the three properties that make it worth having rather than noise:

  1. it fires on the MISSING section and only on that one
  2. it does not fire in a language it was not written in (a monolingual term list would report
     every CJK deck as missing every section)
  3. it binds ONLY on a recorded purpose it recognises — a genre outside the registry is NOT
     CHECKED, never a guessed section list
