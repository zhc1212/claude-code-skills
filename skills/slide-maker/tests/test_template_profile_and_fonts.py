"""The two hand-off gates added for the template branch, both directions each.

`check_template_profile.py` — a registered template's profile.md must be OBEYED. The registry is
the one artefact in this skill with a memory across decks, and nothing read it. The important
property is not that it catches violations (it does) but that a profile with NO contract block
reports NOT CHECKED rather than clean: "there was nothing to check" and "everything checked out"
must never print the same sentence.

`check_fonts_resolve.py` — the faces a deck NAMES must resolve on the machine that MEASURED it.
Not portability (unknowable): every wrap/fit guard sits on `_measure_lines`, so a named-but-absent
face makes the build and the lint compute from the same wrong number and agree with each other.

Run: python3 tests/test_template_profile_and_fonts.py
