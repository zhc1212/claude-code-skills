"""A font inside an app bundle is a font this pipeline cannot verify.

Portability was only ever framed as "will the RECIPIENT have it". The failure that actually cost a
build was the other one: on macOS, Microsoft Office keeps Calibri / Cambria / Aptos INSIDE its own
app folder rather than installing them system-wide. PowerPoint renders them; LibreOffice — the
render loop — and the width-measurement path cannot see them at all. So a deck set in Calibri on
such a machine is laid out against a substitute's metrics (voiding `measure_text`, `vstack`,
`bottom_callout`, `fit_text_size`) and then "verified" against a render of a face nobody will see,
with both linters green the whole way.

Item 10 used to answer that case with "may be fine where the deck is presented" — which is the
wrong risk, stated reassuringly. These hold the distinction.
