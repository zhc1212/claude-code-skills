"""A COPIED install must be able to tell it is not running what main has.

The comparison is git BLOB SHAs fetched from GitHub's trees API — nothing is generated into the
repo, so there is no artifact to keep fresh and none to go stale. It is deliberately ONE-
DIRECTIONAL (does everything I HAVE match main?), because an installer chooses what to copy:
`npx skills add` lands ~55 files where the tree has ~193, and demanding an exact set would report
"differs" on every correct install forever.

🔴 THE MEASURED DEFECT. `check_version.py` on a copy install compared `VERSION` against the one on
GitHub. `VERSION` only moves on a RELEASE, so every commit between releases — the development case,
which is most of the time — was invisible. Tested directly before this file existed: a copy whose
`SKILL.md` had been truncated to 2,000 bytes of 278,400 (99.3% of the skill gone) passed
`check_version.py --force` SILENTLY with exit 0, because its VERSION still read `5.2.0`. The real
cost, in one session: the installed copy was three commits behind, the check said nothing, and a
deck was built by a skill that did not contain rules the repo had already fixed and pushed.

A version string cannot answer "am I on main". A content fingerprint can, without hooking an
installer we do not own.
