"""A gate report must stay readable when an agent reads only the TAIL of it.

🔴 WHY. Batching every fault into one run is only half the win. The other half is that the reader
actually SEES them — and every agent reads a long report the same way: `2>&1 | tail -N`, because
it wants the verdict without a wall of text. MEASURED, on the real 12-page build that motivated
this work:

  · `deck_gates.py` reported all 9 problems in ONE pass and said so on its FIRST line. The run
    read it through `tail -8`, cut the header off, fixed the three rows it could see, and paid
    three more round-trips finding the rest. The gate was right; the window hid the total.
  · `render_deck.py --gate-check` was worse. Under a pipe stdout is block-buffered and stderr is
    not, so its 30 stderr lines of FAILURES came out AHEAD of its 36 stdout `[gates]` lines in a
    `2>&1` merge. `tail -20` showed nothing but informational chatter and NOT ONE failure — a
    blocked gate that reads as clean.
  · `codex_delivery_gate.py` printed a bare `- ` list: no numbering, no total, so any window shows
    some errors with no hint that more exist.

So the invariant is not "the report contains the count" — it is "EVERY tail window reveals it".
`[4/9]` on each line plus a trailing total gives that for free, in any window of one line or more.
