"""The counterweight: a deck can now be held for being measurably SAFE, not only for erring.

WHY. Every blocking signal in this skill punished a deck for being too much or too same. Nothing
could hold one for being too timid: `TIMID COVER` and `FLAT TYPE` are deliberately excluded from
SAMENESS_CODES, and the only force that could call a deck forgettable — the critic's
distinctiveness axis — is non-blocking at the default `balanced+` dial and lives inside a review
the user may decline.

Measured on a real 12-page build: ten iterations, every one driven by an advisory, every one making
the deck flatter. The dark pivot page was deleted to satisfy ONE-OFF CANVAS FLIP; content was cut
to satisfy TEXT WALL; the type scale collapsed to satisfy SIZE SPRAWL. Each of those advisories
names the ambitious repair FIRST — "enrich with a second column of substance", "repeat the
treatment as a divider family" — but subtraction is the cheaper way to make a number go away, and
with feedback on one side only, the cheap way always wins. The user's verdict was 设计能力变弱了,
and nothing in the pipeline had said so.

Both directions are asserted, because a miscalibrated gate on THIS side is worse than none — it
would punish exactly the restrained registers the skill protects:

  BLOCKS      a text-only, greyscale, timid-cover deck.
  DOES NOT    fire on a deck whose pages carry real protagonists (charts, figures).
  STANDS DOWN under `boldness: conservative` + a recorded `deliberately restrained` move, and
              under the size/aspect floors, exactly like the sameness gate.
  WAIVABLE    only by NAMING the register, with a codes list bound to this state of the deck.
