"""A hand-typed record gets the FIELD NAMES wrong, and the gate can see that it was hand-typed.

🔴 MEASURED, twice in one session. A run wrote the `.deck-gates.json` composition block by hand
and used `name` where the contract says `label` — one round-trip. It then wrote the `why` clause
with abbreviations ("A / B / C") and the gate rejected it for not naming what was compared —
another round-trip. Both were shaped correctly in the template `deck_gates.py init` writes, and
the skill has said "write the record with deck_gates.py, not by hand" in prose the whole time.

Prose is not a check. This one prints beside the findings, at the moment the mistake surfaces, and
never blocks — the record may legitimately drop a block (a no-source deck writes no open ledger),
so it fires on a COUNT of absent `init`-always-writes blocks rather than on any single key.

Note what this file does NOT claim: the shared scaffold was audited the same way as the Codex one
(fill it, run the real gate, look for fields it demands that the template never showed) and came
back COMPLETE — `label`, `picked` and `why` are all in it, with the "name the versions you
compared" instruction included. The defect was never a missing field; it was that nothing stopped
an author from bypassing the template.
