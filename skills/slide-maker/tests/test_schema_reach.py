"""A gate that CALLS a checker on both runtimes can still be unable to READ either one's record.

🔴 THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, measured. `check_purpose` was wired into both gate paths and
`check_gate_parity` reported 21 sections, 0 problems — correctly, by its own definition: it checks
that each `_gate_section` is *reachable* in `codex_delivery_gate.py`, and it was. But the extractor
read `design.purpose`, and inspecting the REAL scaffold that `codex_delivery_gate.py --init` writes
showed the Codex schema has no `purpose` key anywhere — not top level, not under `design`. The gate
existed on that runtime and could almost never bind. Parity was green the whole time.

That hole is structural, not a one-off: parity compares FILES, and this compares BEHAVIOUR. Split
by hand across the two paths, the reads that could carry it are

    shared  25 record reads — 19 are waiver lookups, 6 FEED a check
    codex   42 record reads — 11 are waiver lookups, 31 FEED a check

and the dangerous ones are the FEEDING reads' nested paths, because the top-level keys (`design`,
`interview`, `content`) do exist in both scaffolds. A static scan cannot settle this: the extractor
that failed loops over a tuple of candidate key names, which no regex reads.

So each extractor here is run against a PLAUSIBLY FILLED record for BOTH runtimes, filled the way
that runtime actually fills it, and must find what it needs on both. A `NOT CHECKED` that nobody
can ever clear is indistinguishable from a passing gate, which is the whole failure class.
