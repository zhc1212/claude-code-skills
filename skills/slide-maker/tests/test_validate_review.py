"""`validate_review.py` is the ONLY gate on the critic, and it had three fixtures.

The review contract is where a deck's quality claim becomes machine-checkable: the critic is
the one judgement that cannot be self-certified, and this validator is the only thing standing
between "a critic consented" and "a JSON file says consent". It carries ~30 distinct rules and
its whole test suite was `--selftest`'s three inline fixtures — one valid critic, one broken
critic, one arbiter pair. By comparison the waiver gate next door has 770 lines of tests.

Worse, the canonical `good_critic` fixture set `"plan_audit": None` — the documented escape
hatch for direction previews — so the positive path never exercised a populated audit at all.
That is exactly where the hole was: `{"plan_audit": {}}` with `contract_card_seen: true` and no
`probes` validated clean and consented, while `agents/critic.md:987` told the critic that the
main loop "rejects a review whose lens-required probe fields or plan_audit subfields are
missing". This suite exists so that sentence is true and stays true.

Both directions are asserted throughout. A gate that only rejects is as broken as one that only
accepts: over-rejecting here means a per-section critic or a direction preview cannot file a
legitimate review, and the first honest failure teaches everyone to bypass the gate.
