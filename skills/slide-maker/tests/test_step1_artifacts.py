"""Step 1 and Step 2 must leave ARTIFACTS, not a report about themselves.

WHY. Measured across one session, from the transcript rather than from memory:

  deck              interview?   arc_divergence.py runs   content checkpoint table posted
  DeepSeek Harness  yes          3                        1
  Paris v1          delegated    0                        0
  Paris travel      delegated    0                        0

Both delegated decks passed every hand-off gate. Both are the decks whose design was judged flat
and whose direction was judged wrong. The one with a real interview is the one that ran the
pipeline. The trigger is the per-deck AUTO WAIVER: it converts the two 🔴 stops into FYIs, and an
FYI is prose with no backstop — the class this skill's own enforcement invariant ranks last.

Three holes are closed here, and the first is the sharpest:

  ARC RECOMPUTED   `content.arc.divergence` was a STRING the run wrote about itself. A delivered
                   deck passed with the two characters "ok" while `arc_divergence.py` had never
                   been invoked for it. The gate now takes `candidates` and runs `check()` itself,
                   so passing costs the work rather than the sentence.
  CONTENT.SLIDES   the content checkpoint's own table (`# | 角色 | 记忆句 | 承载证据 | units`)
                   reaches the gate file. NOT a new field: codex_delivery_gate has required
                   `content.slides` all along — the asymmetry was that the CODEX path demanded the
                   artifact and the shared path did not.
  CHECKPOINT MODE  `content.checkpoint` / `design.checkpoint`, mode `approved` | `auto` — also
                   codex's existing spelling. Delegation must change WHO approves, not WHETHER the
                   step happened, and the hand-off must say which one it got.
