"""The hand-off gate reports EVERY failure in one run, and reports them no more softly.

WHY. `check_handoff_gates` used to stop at the first problem: 45 `die()` sites across ~15
independent stop classes, one per run. A thin `.deck-gates.json` therefore cost one
fail → fix → re-run round-trip PER FIELD, at the most expensive moment of the session (hand-off,
full context). `codex_delivery_gate.py` already accumulated its `errors` list, and
`validate_review.py`'s docstring already named "the ping-pong of one-error-at-a-time retries" as
the anti-pattern; this path was the holdout.

The batching is only worth having if it did not weaken anything, so both directions are asserted:

  BATCHES   — a record with N independent problems names all N in ONE run.
  STILL BLOCKS — nonzero exit, no pass line, and every message that fired before still fires.
  NO MASKING — within one section the FIRST stop still wins (its later checks read values the
               failed one was supposed to establish, so continuing would invent follow-on faults),
               and across sections nothing is suppressed.
  CLEAN IS CLEAN — a complete record still passes silently. A batching bug that reported phantom
               problems on a good deck would be worse than the ping-pong it replaced.
