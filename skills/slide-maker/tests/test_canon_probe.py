"""The canon rules that were made measurable must FIRE on the defect and stay silent on real decks.

This skill cites Duarte, Minto, CRAP, Mayer, Gestalt and cognitive load — all in prose, none
measured, which by its own enforcement invariant makes them advisory. `canon_probe.py` converts the
three that a built .pptx can actually decide. Each threshold was calibrated on 29 delivered decks /
349 slides, never on invented examples, and the calibration REJECTED two formulations outright:

  · Knaflic's declarative title, measured as overlap with the recorded takeaway: median 0.33, and
    the BEST titles score LOWEST ("Door one: buy" = 0.07) because a sharp title re-words on
    purpose. Judging "declarative" is taste; only the bare category label is mechanical.
  · Gestalt proximity: four formulations, all cry-wolf or silent — a .pptx records coordinates and
    no notion of which shapes belong together. See the module docstring.

So this file asserts BOTH directions for every rule that shipped: it catches the defect, and it
does not fire on a clean deck. A guard with 0 false positives that also never fires is not a guard.
