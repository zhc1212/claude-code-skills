"""Runtime drift must be impossible to introduce silently.

The two gate paths have drifted apart three times — `png`/`path`, `design_plan`/`design`, and
`checkpoints` — each time invisibly, because a gate that never runs and a gate that passes look
identical from outside. This suite attacks the guard rather than running it: a guard that only ever
prints green is the same failure one level up.
