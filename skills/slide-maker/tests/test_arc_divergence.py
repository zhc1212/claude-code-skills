"""The arc-candidate divergence gate — and the two collapses it exists to separate.

The design side has had `directions_diversity.py` for a while; this is its content-side twin, and
the tests below are mostly about the ways the twin is NOT identical:

  · directions collapse into three colourways of one layout — equally developed, equally shallow.
  · arcs collapse into one real argument plus two foils — genuinely different, wildly unequal.

A divergence measure alone scores the second case as a healthy set (a two-beat sketch diverges
beautifully from a twelve-beat argument), which is why `check()` returns `sketches` separately and
why there are tests for each collapse independently.

The CJK cases are the load-bearing ones. This repo has already shipped a measurement that read
Chinese text with Latin assumptions and was silently 46% wrong; a whitespace tokeniser here would
score every pair of Chinese closing asks at 0.0 and turn two of the four axes off on every Chinese
deck — passing, quietly, forever. Both directions are tested: a Chinese collapse must FIRE, and
two genuinely different Chinese arcs must NOT.
