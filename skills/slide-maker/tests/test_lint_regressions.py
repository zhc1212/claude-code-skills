"""Two-sided regression test for the render-time lint.

Every check here exists because a REAL deck shipped the defect, or because a real deck was
falsely flagged for craft. The two directions matter equally and are asserted separately:

  PASS deck — ordinary, correctly-built slides plus two DECLARED exceptions (a rhymed triptych,
              a quiet pause page). Zero hard findings. A change that breaks one of these is
              catching craft rather than defects, which is how a rule set makes decks worse.
  FAIL deck — one slide per defect the gates must catch. Each was clean before these checks
              existed; that was the bug.
