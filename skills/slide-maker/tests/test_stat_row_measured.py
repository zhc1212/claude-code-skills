"""`stat_row`'s figure block must be sized by its figure, not by a constant.

🔴 MEASURED. The figure sat in a hardcoded 0.7in box with the caption pinned at `y + 0.66`, while
`fig_size` was a parameter the caller sets. A 44pt figure is 0.684in of ink, so the caption's TOP
landed inside the figure's last line: `TEXT COLLISION` on EVERY column, for any `fig_size` above
about 43. Two things made it expensive to find — it surfaces only at RENDER time (the build-time
geometry pass reports clean), and it is identical in Chinese and Latin, so a CJK deck sends you
hunting the wrong bug. Found by sweeping 28/34/40/44/52 through a real render+lint.

This file pins the fix at both ends: the collision is gone at the sizes that broke, and every deck
at or below the historical default lands EXACTLY where it did before.
