"""Every citation this skill had ever built was typed by hand, and nothing checked it against a .bib.

Measured before `scripts/citations.py`: `sources_page` renders a list of STRINGS and `source_note`
renders a provenance line of STRINGS. Nothing read a bibliography, nothing linked an in-text marker
to a reference list, and nothing could tell a correct year from a remembered one. Retyping is where
a year drifts by one and a middle author disappears — and on a slide, a misattributed result is a
claim about a real person's work.

What is pinned here:
  * the PARSER, against the shapes a real bibliography has (braced titles, LaTeX accents, quoted
    and parenthesised entries, particled surnames) rather than against a tidy fixture;
  * the REFUSAL — no author, no title or no year raises instead of printing `n.d.`, which is this
    skill's never-invent floor applied to the one place a fabrication is unfalsifiable;
  * the GATE, against a REAL BUILT DECK: a dangling marker, a cited key that is on no slide, an
    entry nothing cites, and both NOT CHECKED refusals.

Run: python3 tests/test_citations.py
