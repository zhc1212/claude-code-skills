"""A freshness finding must name EVERY near neighbour, or clearing it becomes a search.

🔴 MEASURED, on a real 12-page build. `GROUND REPEAT` named one previous deck and `break`ed. The
author moved the canvas off it — and landed inside the tolerance of the NEXT deck in the history,
which the checker had known about the whole time. Three fail -> fix -> re-run rounds
(#F4F1EA -> #F0EADA -> #EADFBE) to learn a constraint that was fully computable on the first.

Reproduced exactly here: against a three-deck history, #F4F1EA is near ALL THREE, #F0EADA is near
two, and only the third value clears. One report naming all three, with the distances and the
threshold, turns that search into a single move.

The finding must also STILL FIRE and still block — a message that names more while catching less
would be a worse trade than the round-trips.
