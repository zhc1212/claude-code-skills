"""The clinical / evidence-synthesis forms: the numbers, the guards, and the routing.

These components exist because `design-by-topic.md` listed "Medicine / biotech / clinical" as a
first-class domain while a grep for kaplan-meier / forest / CONSORT / Bland-Altman / ROC across
references + scripts + agents returned nothing: the skill could STYLE a clinical deck and could
not DRAW one.

Each component owns a rule that is wrong BY DEFAULT when the form is hand-rolled, and a wrong
chart is a perfectly well-formed set of shapes — no geometry lint can see one. So this suite
checks three things and not just that the code runs:

  1. the ESTIMATORS against hand-computable answers (a KM ladder, a published AUC, an SD)
  2. every GUARD in both directions — the bad input raises, the good input does not
  3. the ROUTING — a form nobody is pointed at is a form nobody picks

Run: python3 tests/test_clinical_forms.py
