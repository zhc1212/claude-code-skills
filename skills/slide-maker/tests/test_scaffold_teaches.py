"""The scaffold is what this skill actually teaches, so it is checked like a contract.

SKILL.md tells every single-author build to copy `references/examples/build_example_generic.py`.
That makes the file the skill's real curriculum: whatever it demonstrates is what gets written,
and whatever it omits effectively does not exist. Measured before this suite, on a real 14-page
build and on the file itself:

    vstack          0 occurrences        hand-picked y   6 occurrences
    content_band    0                    register_mark   0
    tag_motif       0

The consequences were not hypothetical. The build hand-computed nearly every y and spent many
rounds nudging coordinates; `vstack`'s first honest error ("blocks need 3.68in but the band is
only 2.88in" — the page is OVER-FULL, which no nudge can fix) arrived on round twelve instead of
round one. And 383 shapes in the delivered deck carried ZERO motif tags, so `TEXT_OVER_MOTIF` —
written for that deck's own cover defect — reported nothing on it.

Both are ADOPTION failures, not capability gaps, and adoption is decided by the example. So the
example is now asserted: it must demonstrate the measured-packer idiom and the motif tag, and it
must not teach the hand-picked-y idiom it used to. This suite fails loudly if either regresses,
which is the only thing that keeps a curriculum honest.
