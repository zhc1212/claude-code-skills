"""The composition competition: the signature page is CHOSEN between, not composed once.

The module's `--selftest` builds the calibration pairs and proves the floor separates them. This
file covers what that cannot: that the measure means what it claims on inputs it was not tuned on,
that it generalises off 16:9 and off English, that the contract is wired into every gate path
identically, and that the anti-theatre check cannot be satisfied by restyling one layout.
