"""A rule whose documented exception cannot be recorded forces a FALSE record.

Three of these were hit in one session, and they share a shape: the skill states a legitimate
exception, the gate has no way to express it, and the author writes something untrue to get past.

1. `material_probe` — Step 2 says the probe is skipped on "a registered/provided template or a
   Mode-A mimic … or a 1-2 slide tiny ask". `grep -c 'material_probe.*waiv'` was **0 in both
   gates**. A deck on a registered template had to invent a probe artifact and write a note into
   the record explaining that the gate and the prose disagreed.
2. `icon_none_category` — the four values all make a claim about the DECK, and none can say *the
   user asked for no icons*. A deck whose user said 「不需要icon」 was filed `template-locked`, a
   different claim — and the Codex gate VERIFIES that claim against the built file, so a forced
   label can also fail for the wrong reason.
3. `NO NOTES` — `builds="static"` exists so a user's opt-out stops reading as an omission.
   Removing the spoken script is the same kind of decision and had nowhere to live, so the warning
   fired on every lint run forever.

Plus the divergence nothing watched for: a user's hand-edits to a delivered .pptx were invisible to
every tool in the repo.
