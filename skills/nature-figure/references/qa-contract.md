Use this before final delivery, before a revision package, and whenever the figure
contains microscopy, blots, gels, clinical subgroup analysis, or statistical claims.
Journal rules change, so verify the latest target journal author guide for final
submission. The values below are conservative defaults for Nature-family style work.
For the flagship journal Nature, load `nature-article-requirements.md` and use
its stage-specific main-figure, Extended Data and legend contracts.

## Pre-submission checklist

| Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Core conclusion | One-sentence claim exists and every panel maps to it |
| Archetype | Figure has a declared archetype and panel hierarchy |
| Backend exclusivity | The selected backend produced all plotting, previews, exports, and visual QA renders |
| Final size | Single-column about 89 mm or double-column about 183 mm, height not above target journal limit |
| Text size | Body/tick/legend text is readable at final size, usually 5-7 pt for dense journal figures |
| Rendered glyph floor | Every PDF text run, including math superscripts/subscripts, is at least 5 pt |
| Panel labels | Lowercase, bold, near top-left, typically 8 pt at final size |
| Editable text | SVG/PDF text remains editable; no outlined text unless unavoidable for special symbols |
| Font | Arial/Helvetica/sans-serif fallback is used consistently |
| Color | No rainbow color maps; red/green is not the only encoding; grayscale print remains interpretable |
| Legend strategy | Shared or direct labels where possible; no repeated redundant legends |
| Display terminology | Legend labels use display-style initial capitalization and preserve canonical model names |
| Statistics | `n`, biological/technical repeat definition, center, spread, test, correction, and exact comparison are documented |
| Comparable uncertainty | Every comparable seed/fold/split aggregate panel shows the same variability definition or documents an exemption |
| Annotation clearance | Automatic PDF collision audit has no FAIL findings; every WARN is reviewed at final size and justified or fixed |
| Panel alignment | Every multi-panel figure has a fresh alignment JSON; comparable row/column edges, dimensions, labels and repeated gutters are within 1.5 pt or carry a reasoned exemption |
| Visual hierarchy | Hero evidence remains more salient than neutral baselines after rendering |
| Numerical transforms | Interpolation/normalization direction and monotonicity assumptions are asserted in code |
| Source data | Quantitative panels can be traced to a clean CSV/TSV/XLSX or script output |
| Raster resolution | Photos/microscopy are high-resolution enough for final size; line art uses vector where possible |
| Microscopy scale | Scale bar is present, calibrated, and not only a magnification factor |
| Image integrity | Crop, contrast, pseudo-color, stitching, reuse, and raw-file provenance are recorded |
| Export bundle | Script, source data, SVG, PDF, TIFF/PNG preview, and QA notes are delivered together when requested; previews are not mislabeled as accepted main-figure upload formats |

## Statistics legend minimum

For each quantitative panel, capture:

```text
n definition:
biological replicates:
technical replicates:
center statistic:
spread/interval:
test:
multiple-comparison correction:
p-value display:
source-data file:
```

For machine-learning/model figures, also capture:

```text
train/validation/test split:
number of seeds or folds:
metric definition:
confidence interval or variability definition:
baseline definition:
```

## Image-integrity minimum

For each image panel, capture:

```text
raw file:
processed file:
crop:
brightness/contrast/gamma:
pseudo-color:
scale calibration:
stitching:
reuse in other figures:
quantification link:
```

Global adjustments are generally safer than local selective edits. If an adjustment
changes the visibility of relevant background or bands, flag it instead of silently
normalizing it away.

## Automated source preflight

Run the dependency-free validator on the final plotting source before rendering the delivery bundle:

```bash
# Python source
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/validate_figure.py path/to/figure.py

# R, R Markdown, or Quarto source
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/validate_figure.py path/to/figure.R

# Machine-readable report or stricter warning gate
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/validate_figure.py path/to/figure.py --json
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/validate_figure.py path/to/figure.py --strict

# Exported-PDF glyph-size audit
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/audit_pdf_text.py path/to/figure.pdf --min-pt 5
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/audit_pdf_text.py path/to/figure.pdf --min-pt 5 --json

# Backend-neutral audit of the render-time Python/R panel-layout manifest
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/audit_panel_alignment.py path/to/figure.alignment-layout.json \
  --json-out path/to/figure.alignment.json \
  --overlay-svg path/to/figure.alignment.svg \
  --strict

# Mandatory rendered collision audit for Python and R figures
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/audit_figure_collisions.py path/to/figure.pdf \
  --json-out path/to/figure.collision-audit.json \
  --overlay-pdf path/to/figure.collision-audit.pdf

# Optional: make ambiguous WARN findings blocking
python skills/nature-figure/scripts/audit_figure_collisions.py path/to/figure.pdf --strict
```

The source preflight checks syntax, font configuration and size floor, mathtext shrinkage risk, literal legend-label capitalization, unsafe color maps, editable-text settings, vector/raster exports, DPI, common journal widths, potential sampling or unreported missing-data exclusion, simulated-data leakage, log guards, interpolation monotonicity, stochastic uncertainty encoding, rotated-text anchoring, risky annotation workarounds, and obvious cross-backend plotting references. The panel-alignment gate reads final axes/grob rectangles measured by the selected backend and applies one physical-point contract to Python and R. The PDF text audit scans supported content streams for actual `Tf` font-size operators and catches reduced script glyphs that source-level `fontsize` checks miss. The rendered collision audit uses PyMuPDF geometry from the final PDF and therefore applies equally to Python- and R-generated figures.

Treat the result as a deterministic source audit, not as evidence that the analysis or rendered figure is correct. Resolve all `FAIL` findings before delivery. Review every `WARN`, then run the selected backend and inspect the actual SVG/PDF/TIFF/PNG outputs at final size. A warning may be acceptable only when the QA notes state the reason.

## Automatic multi-panel alignment gate

Run the gate for every figure with at least two comparable panels, after the
final layout engine has drawn fonts, legends, colorbars and constrained/tight
layout, and before exporting submission files. Rerun it after any change that
can affect panel geometry. A single-panel figure is `not applicable`; a
multi-panel figure with no declared or inferable comparison groups is `NOT
AUDITABLE`, not a pass.

The default tolerance is `1.5 pt` (about `0.53 mm`) at final physical size. The
auditor checks:

- panels in one row: common top and bottom edges plus equal plot-area height;
- three or four same-row panels with equal grid spans: equal final plot-area
  widths within `1.5 pt`;
- panels in one column: common left and right edges plus equal plot-area width;
- unequal-span grid panels: shared outer start/stop edges, including automatic
  `left two + right one` and `left one + right two` arrangements;
- three or more comparable panels: uniform repeated horizontal/vertical gutters;
- detectable bold lowercase top-left panel labels: common y anchors within rows
  and common x anchors within columns;
- plot-area rectangles do not overlap.

For Matplotlib, copy `audit_panel_alignment.py` beside the plotting script or
add the skill scripts directory to `PYTHONPATH`, then call this after the last
layout change:

```python
from audit_panel_alignment import require_matplotlib_panel_alignment

require_matplotlib_panel_alignment(
    fig,
    json_out="figure.alignment.json",
    overlay_svg="figure.alignment.svg",
    tolerance_pt=1.5,
    gutter_tolerance_pt=1.5,
    require_panel_labels=True,
    strict=True,
)
```

Ordinary `subplots`/`GridSpec` row and column groups are inferred from
`SubplotSpec`. A panel spanning both grid rows is automatically compared with
the upper small panel at their shared top boundary and the lower small panel at
their shared bottom boundary; this works whether the spanning panel is in the
left or right column. The spanning panel is not incorrectly required to equal
either small panel's height. Position outside panel letters with a fixed point
offset from the axes corner rather than a shared axes-fraction offset, because
`y=1.02` produces different physical displacements for tall and short panels.
For a horizontal row of three or four panels, equal column spans imply equal
final widths. Intentional unequal `width_ratios` must use a narrow exemption
such as `{"panels": ["b"], "checks": ["panel-width"], "reason": "middle hero panel"}`;
do not exempt the entire row or increase the tolerance.
Pass explicit `row_groups` and `column_groups` when axes come from nested grids
or separately created containers. Exclude a
colorbar or inset with `exclude_axes=[...]`, or add an exemption containing the
affected panel, the exact checks and a non-empty scientific/layout reason.

For R/patchwork, source `panel_alignment.R` and call
`require_patchwork_panel_alignment()` with the same width/height used for final
export. Common patchwork groups and structured unequal-span designs are inferred
from gtable cells, including two stacked panels beside a two-row spanning panel
in either column. Same-row groups of three or four equal gtable spans must also
have equal final widths. Nested or manually positioned designs must provide explicit
`row_groups` / `column_groups`. The R helper requires `patchwork`, `grid` and
`jsonlite`; it measures in R and invokes the Python CLI only to audit the
resulting JSON, so it does not redraw or replace the R figure.

| Result | Required action |
|---|---|
| `NOT APPLICABLE`, exit `0` | Single rendered plot-area only; preserve the JSON and continue |
| `PASS`, exit `0` | Preserve the alignment JSON and continue to export/PDF QA |
| `FIX BEFORE DELIVERY`, exit `1` | Correct the selected-backend layout and rerun; do not export the delivery bundle |
| `REVIEW REQUIRED` | Resolve WARN or document it; `--strict` makes WARN blocking |
| `NOT AUDITABLE`, exit `2` | Supply valid measured geometry and comparison groups; do not claim alignment passed |

The QA-only alignment SVG shows measured panel rectangles, not scientific
content. It must not replace the selected backend's figure. Do not weaken the
global tolerance to hide one exception. Structured grid spanning is audited
automatically; a free-positioned hero panel, inset, legend-only axis or colorbar
should be omitted from unrelated groups or carry a specific exemption reason.

## Automatic rendered collision audit

Run `audit_figure_collisions.py` after **every generated figure and every
revision that can change layout**, including edits to text, fonts, legend,
annotations, axes, data, uncertainty, panel size or arrangement. Do not reuse a
report from an earlier render. Preserve the JSON report with the delivery QA;
the marked PDF is diagnostic only.

| Result | Meaning | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| `text-text` FAIL | Two rendered text boxes materially overlap | Separate, shorten, rotate or resize the labels and rerun |
| `text-stroke` FAIL | A line, curve, marker edge, error bar or other stroked path crosses the interior of text | Move the text or alter the layout; do not hide the path with an opaque white box |
| `text-page-clipping` FAIL | A rendered text trace extends beyond the final PDF page | Expand/reposition the layout and re-export |
| `text-fill-edge` WARN | Text only partly overlaps a bar, heatmap cell or other fill | Inspect at final size; fix unless the edge overlap is intentional and legible |
| `text-image-edge` WARN | Text only partly overlaps a raster image boundary | Inspect panel labels, scale bars and image annotations at final size |
| contained overlay count | Text is fully inside a fill or image | Informational because in-bar labels, heatmap values and image annotations can be intentional |

Exit code `1` and verdict `FIX BEFORE DELIVERY` block delivery. Exit code `2`
or `NOT AUDITABLE` means the PDF/dependency could not be checked and must not be
reported as a pass. `REVIEW REQUIRED` does not silently pass: inspect each WARN
and record the reason, or use `--strict` to make WARN blocking. PyMuPDF is
declared in `requirements.txt`; install it with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r skills/nature-figure/requirements.txt
```

The detector deliberately separates reliable geometry failures from ambiguous
fill/image overlays. It does not prove visual quality, semantic correctness,
adequate contrast or accessibility, so the final-size panel audit remains
mandatory.

## Rendered panel-by-panel audit

Do not approve a figure from a whole-page glance. Inspect each panel at final physical size, then inspect the assembled figure. Record one row per panel:

| Panel | Unique claim | Center/summary | Spread/interval | Replicate unit | Labels/legend | Alignment group/result | Collision check | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| a | What question only this panel answers | mean/median/raw | SD/SE/CI/none + reason | seeds/folds/subjects/etc. | exact display labels | row/column group, deviation or exemption | collision report findings + data/error extent + text bbox | yes/no |

Cover each panel mentally. If the figure's argument remains complete, merge or remove that panel. Compare repeated panels side by side for consistent terminology, uncertainty, axes, and color mapping. After adding error bars or uncertainty bands, remove arrows, brackets, or fills that encode the same gap and occupy the same geometry.

## Typography and PDF glyph floor

- The 5 pt floor applies to every rendered glyph, not only the parent `fontsize` in source code.
- Matplotlib mathtext commonly scales superscripts/subscripts to about 0.7 of the parent. A 7 pt `$R^2$` can therefore contain a 4.9 pt glyph. Prefer a Unicode glyph such as `R²` when it preserves the intended notation, or increase the parent size and confirm the PDF audit.
- Measure long labels against their allocated group width at final size. Compare rendered text bounding-box width in millimetres with the available slot; do not rely on the source font number alone.
- Keep canonical capitalization such as `XGBoost`, `DeepSeek`, `GPT-5.2`, and `RF`. Legend labels start with display-style capitalization, while prose follows normal sentence grammar. Do not use blind string title-casing.

## Uncertainty consistency

- If a line or bar is a mean/median across random seeds, folds, splits, subjects, or repeated experiments, encode the requested spread in every comparable panel.
- State the exact definition, for example `median ± one seed SD`, in the legend or panel notes. Do not infer or invent it.
- Presence of one `fill_between`, `errorbar`, `yerr`, or `geom_errorbar` call does not prove coverage. Use the panel audit table to verify every comparable panel.
- Recompute label clearance from the upper uncertainty extent after error bars are added.

## Geometry and annotation placement

- Measure spacing between the actual objects being compared. Use rendered/tight bounding boxes for panel-to-legend or legend-row gaps; scanning an entire raster row can mix unrelated objects at different horizontal positions.
- Use plot-area rectangles for axes alignment and tight bounding boxes for outer-content clearance; do not confuse unequal tick-label widths with a shifted data rectangle.
- Derive label positions from data and uncertainty bounds, for example `max(center + spread) + margin`, rather than a fixed `LABEL_Y`.
- For rotated Matplotlib text, use `rotation_mode="anchor"` and verify the final bounding box.
- If a curve crosses a label, reposition the label beyond the local data envelope. Avoid opaque white `bbox` masks that cut a conspicuous hole in a line.
- Equal pixel y-coordinates can still look uneven when bar heights create unequal whitespace. Diagnose the perceived gap before moving already aligned labels.

## Color separation and salience

- Pairwise ΔE and white-background contrast are necessary checks, not a complete design test.
- Verify hierarchy after rendering: neutral baselines should not appear stronger than the proposed method or primary evidence.
- Do not repurpose a sequential light-to-dark palette as unrelated categorical colors merely because the hues look attractive.
- Check grayscale and color-vision robustness, then inspect the actual figure because metrics do not encode which series should dominate attention.

## Transformation and paired-effect checks

- `numpy.interp` requires increasing `xp`. Use `scripts/figure_safety.py::interp_monotone`, or explicitly assert monotonicity and reverse/sort `xp` and `fp` together. Plausible-looking output is not evidence of correctness.
- Do not plan one figure per source table. Group panels by the distinct claims they support.
- When repeated units are matched, inspect paired differences. Broad between-dataset or between-subject heterogeneity can make four marginal distributions overlap even when the within-unit effect is strong; use a paired-difference view when the scientific claim is paired.

## Export checks

Run only the export block for the selected backend. If that backend is unavailable,
stop and report the missing runtime/package instead of producing a substitute export
with the other language.

### Python

```python
import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams["svg.fonttype"] = "none"
mpl.rcParams["pdf.fonttype"] = 42
fig.savefig("figure.svg", bbox_inches="tight")
fig.savefig("figure.pdf", bbox_inches="tight")
fig.savefig("figure.tiff", dpi=600, bbox_inches="tight")
```

### R

```r
svglite::svglite("figure.svg", width = width_mm / 25.4, height = height_mm / 25.4)
print(plot)
dev.off()

grDevices::cairo_pdf("figure.pdf", width = width_mm / 25.4, height = height_mm / 25.4, family = "Arial")
print(plot)
dev.off()

ragg::agg_tiff("figure.tiff", width = width_mm / 25.4, height = height_mm / 25.4, units = "in", res = 600)
print(plot)
dev.off()
```

Open the SVG/PDF after export and verify that text can be selected, labels do not
overlap, and the figure still reads at final printed size.
