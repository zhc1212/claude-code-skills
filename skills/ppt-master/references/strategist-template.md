# Strategist Template Planning

Conditional extension for applying an installed Brand/Style/Layout/Deck workspace to Stage 2 recommendations and the execution lock.

**Trigger**: Load only after Stage 1 confirms a library or explicit workspace selection and the post-confirmation apply stage either installs it into `<project_path>/templates/` or confirms that the target project is consuming it in place. Bare template names, style words, and free-design projects do not trigger this module.

---

## 1. AI-Authored Template Application Plan

**Template vs preset**: A style mention and a Style workspace are different inputs. Bare names and style words remain interpretive input and never resolve to a local path; only a selected and installed workspace activates the rules below. Every installed `<project_path>/templates/design_spec.<kind>.<id>.md` is a template-design source; read all of them. The presence of a `design_spec.style.*.md` file is what marks an active Direction / method segment. Whether a source root was labelled `library` or `explicit` is installation provenance only and never affects Stage-2 precedence.

**Legacy template boundary**: A Layout/Deck template containing `native_structure.json`, `source_template.pptx`, missing root Master identity, direct atomic placeholders, or old `baseline` / `preserve` / distillation metadata is not a Generate Step 3 input. Create a current workspace through [`create-template`](../workflows/create-template.md), preferably from the original PPTX when native topology matters. Brand and Style are intentionally roster-free; never reject either for omitting SVG or Master identity. Do not mutate the input in place.

**No template-mode confirmation**: Never ask the user to select `template_reuse_scope`, `template_adherence`, `mirror`, `layout`, `style`, `strict`, or `adaptive`. These are internal execution values for the current exporter. The user communicates intent in natural language; explicit instructions such as “全部原样保留”, “从中选合适的页面”, “可以重组”, or “只参考视觉” are authoritative. Without an explicit instruction, Strategist decides.

**Hard rule — no Stage-1 influence**: Do not load this module, the installed template spec, prototypes, assets, or template canvas while authoring Stage 1. Stage 1 is already confirmed when this module begins; never revise it to match the workspace.

Immediately before authoring the Stage-2 solution, load each relevant template
resource once per path + SHA and inspect:

- every installed `design_spec.<kind>.<id>.md`; for Layout/Deck only, also inspect the actual Page Roster and relevant SVG prototypes;
- the Identity, Structure, Reusable Application Context, and Direction / method segment owners, resolved here from the installed set under [`apply-template-workspace`](../workflows/stages/apply-template-workspace.md) §5;
- the confirmed current communication contract, source obligations, planned page count, and content shape of every planned page;
- the user's natural-language instructions, including any page names/numbers or elements they explicitly require.

Then author one plan that decides all of the following without presenting an option menu:

- for Layout/Deck, whether the full prototype set, a relevant subset, or only the design language is useful;
- for Layout/Deck, which prototype each generated page starts from, which template pages are skipped, and which prototypes are repeated or reordered;
- whether content is inserted directly, reorganized inside existing structure, or rebuilt under the resolved Direction / method segment;
- for Style, which communication method, visual language, composition rhythm, and information-expression defaults are adopted or adapted without inventing page prototypes;
- which visible elements must remain literal because the user said so, and which may change to serve the current content.

For Layout/Deck, template size is evidence, not policy. A short template may use every prototype when the content genuinely fits; a 20–30 page source may contribute only a few suitable pages, or several pages may be reorganized into a new sequence. Never infer that all pages must be kept or that visible sample content is protected merely because it exists in the template. Style and Brand have no prototype set.

Record the resulting exporter plan internally:

| Internal value | When the authored plan requires it |
|---|---|
| `template_reuse_scope: mirror` | The workspace has `replication_mode: mirror`, the plan calls for literal page reuse, and each page changes only allowed visible text values while preserving visual and text-node topology. |
| `template_reuse_scope: layout` | The plan reuses the template Master/Layout system and prototypes while allowing current-project content and appearance decisions. |
| `template_reuse_scope: style` | A Style-only workspace is active, or the plan uses only communication/design direction, color, typography, decoration language, composition, or rhythm and intentionally creates flat free-design pages. |
| `template_adherence: strict` | Every structured page fits an existing prototype contract without changing its Layout identity or slot topology. Mandatory for `template_reuse_scope: mirror`. |
| `template_adherence: adaptive` | Structured reuse remains useful, but at least one page needs a new explicit Layout under the selected Master. |

Write only the derived values to `spec_lock.md pptx_structure`; omit `template_adherence` for `style`. Do not put these internal values in `design_spec.md`, recommendation stage files, the Confirm UI, or `result.json`.

**Mandatory — natural-language Stage-2 plan**: For Layout/Deck, summarize which prototypes are used/skipped/repeated/reordered, what stays literal, and what may be replaced or reorganized. For Brand/Style, summarize the installed identity or Direction / method constraints and state that pages remain freely composed unless another workspace supplies structure. Write the result to top-level `template_application.value` in `recommendations.stage2.json`; omit it without an active template. After Stage 2, re-read the confirmed `result.json` value (or exact chat answer), never the initial recommendation. Blank returns the decision to Strategist. Persist the effective plan on one line as `- **Template Application**: <prose>` in `design_spec.md §I`, then derive internal reuse/adherence values and mappings; never copy the prose to `spec_lock.md`. Do not add a questionnaire, internal controls, or fixed template-use options.

**Two-stage boundary**: An installed template changes the content of final Stage 2, never the confirmation sequence. Run Stage 1 → final Stage 2 in order in both Confirm UI and chat fallback; do not skip a stage or treat template inspection as user confirmation. On browser timeout, return to the same stage in chat.

---

## 2. Scenario Fit and Inherited Design

**Mandatory — decide from the §1 inspection**: For an installed `kind: deck`, compare the retained Template Overview with the confirmed audience, intent, outcome, delivery context, artifact afterlife, and source obligations. Deck application is reusable context for this comparison, never the current project's application contract and never an override. Compare the retained Page Roster/relevant SVG prototypes with required narrative roles, content shapes, slots, and capacity. Reopen a resource only when its path + SHA changed. The template describes what exists; it never overrides the current project or own required/optional/repeatable or fixed/replaceable/example-only policy. For `kind: layout`, compare only structural roles, slots, and capacity. For an active Style segment, compare its communication method with the current contract and its composition requirements with any selected Layout/Deck structure. Surface a material incompatibility; never silently weaken one segment to make it fit.

| Internal scope | Appropriate when |
|---|---|
| `mirror` | The artifact repeats a known form; literal appearance and text topology are requirements; new content fits existing roles and slots. |
| `layout` | The structural system and brand continue, but the communication outcome requires reflow, new emphasis, or an adaptive Layout. |
| `style` | Only communication/design direction is reused, a Style-only workspace is active, or the outcome requires a different sequence, density, or composition system. |

When the communication contract conflicts with the workspace, choose and state the best-fit application plan in the complete Stage-2 solution. Surface the mismatch only when it materially limits the result; do not respond with a mode questionnaire. Template capability constrains what is legal; scenario fit decides what is useful.

> Internal note: `content_divergence` controls source reorganization; the AI-derived `template_reuse_scope` records the reused layer; `template_adherence` records whether a structured plan keeps or extends existing Layout identities.

**Template design precedence**: Explicit current user instructions and final confirmation win. Brand identity overrides Deck identity, Layout structure overrides Deck structure, and Deck retains only its non-overridden integrated segments plus reusable application context. Style owns Direction / method only: its color, typography, icon, and image values are candidate defaults and never override resolved Brand/Deck identity or become official facts. Preferred Mode / Visual Style values seed Stage 2; the Style overlay must resolve into the final single `mode` and `visual_style` lock rather than create a parallel narrative or aesthetic authority. Style takes this segment ahead of ordinary Stage-2 defaults; actual Deck prototypes and Signature facts remain compatibility constraints, not a second method owner. Library/explicit provenance never changes this order. Each of the three directions still carries six palette roles and complete fonts: repeat fixed Brand/Deck values with `typography.fixed: true`; adapt Style candidates to that identity and vary only open roles. Keep resolved icon and image constraints. Style Review Focus never activates [`visual-review`](../workflows/stages/visual-review.md); only an explicit user request does.

## 3. Structured Lock Planning

For Style-only or Style + Brand, write `pptx_structure.mode: flat` plus `template_reuse_scope: style`; omit `template_adherence` and every structured mapping section. When a Style is installed alongside Layout or Deck, it changes only Direction / method and does not force flat/structured routing. Derive reuse scope from the selected Layout/Deck application plan; a literal `mirror` plan is compatible only when the Style segment requires no visual or topology change.

For `mirror` / `layout`, write `pptx_structure.mode: structured` plus `template_adherence: strict|adaptive`; mirror always writes `strict`. Do not write legacy `baseline`, `template`, `preserve`, `layout_strategy`, or Layout-kind rows.

- **Master roster**: Write one `pptx_masters` row per Master as `<master_key>: <picker name>` and copy the workspace's prototype roster. Keys use 1–64 ASCII letters, digits, dots, underscores, or hyphens, start with a letter/digit, and contain no spaces; human-readable spaces belong only in the picker name. Master visuals are root-level atomic elements and may never be `<g>`.
- **Reusable Layout roster**: Write every unique Layout once as `<layout_key>: <master_key> | <PowerPoint layout name> | <prototype source>`. Copy installed `template:<basename>` sources, including currently unused Layouts. A new adaptive Layout uses its first generated `P<NN>` as source. Reuse a key only when fixed atoms and slot ids/types/indices/bounds/binding modes are identical. Name authored keys after composition, never page topic. A Layout may intentionally have zero slots; do not manufacture an empty `utility` kind or full-page fake slot.
- **Page assignment**: Write exactly one `page_pptx_layouts` row per page. Each key must exist in `pptx_layouts`. Check that distinct compositions do not collapse into role-only keys and that one skeleton does not split into topic-specific keys.
- **Slot planning**: Each reusable slot is a direct root `<g id>` with `data-pptx-placeholder`, positive design-zone bounds, and exactly one compatible direct carrier. Bounds come from the intended safe area, column, panel inset, or media frame—not sample text ink. A genuinely composite region may use only the explicit `object` + `proxy` downgrade.
- **Adaptive refinement**: Initial definitions are complete. If construction shows that reusable framing or slot topology/bounds must change, return to Strategist to add a definition sourced from that page and update its assignment before execution resumes. Executor never mutates or extends the contract; export only compiles declared structure and never discovers or clusters Layouts.
- **Input prototypes**: Add one `page_layouts` row per page. Strict preserves that SVG's contract; adaptive keeps its Master and may declare a new output Layout; mirror also preserves literal visuals and text-node topology.

**Visualization compatibility**: Use `page_layouts` with optional Chart/Table
`page_visualizations` only when the prototype shell can carry the actual §IX
information model. The reference changes neither Layout identity, slot
topology, nor final visualization type. Qualitative relationships stay in §IX
and are composed Slide-locally; they never supply Master/Layout/placeholder
ownership. Without an exact prototype match, adaptive mode starts from the
closest neutral prototype and declares an output Layout; strict mode selects an
existing compatible Layout or revises the outline. Never omit `page_layouts`
on a structured route or write legacy `page_charts` in a new lock.
