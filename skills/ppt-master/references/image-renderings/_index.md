# Renderings — Index

A **rendering** is a visual style family: line quality, texture, depth, material, mood. Lock one rendering per deck — every AI image in the deck shares it.

> **HEX values are not in renderings.** Rendering describes how the image is drawn. The new flow starts from the deck's core color anchors in `spec_lock.md colors` and interprets them with the Design Spec/image context; it does not ask for or author a separate image palette. See [`image-generator.md`](../image-generator.md) §2.

> **Core deck identity has precedence.** Any sample HEX inside an individual rendering file is illustrative legacy prose. Prompt assembly replaces identity roles with the current deck anchors, then may derive coherent tints, light/shadow transitions, material colors, and atmospheric hues from the rendering and image context. Do not replace the deck identity with an unrelated palette. When one derived tone becomes a reusable semantic role across images/pages, promote it to a named lock row.

## 1. Catalog (20 renderings)

Each rendering keeps its own authoritative file with: style paragraph, line / texture / depth notes, deck HEX usage, and a fewshot prompt snippet. Read this index alone while choosing a direction. Only after a preset or custom bases are fixed may the active role read the selected sibling files: one file for a preset, every exact `image_rendering_references` file for a catalog-based custom, and none for a novel custom. Never glob the directory or read an unselected sibling. Whether AI imagery is recommended remains a separate source decision; Image_Generator follows the same selected-only rule.

### 1.1 Modern / commercial (the corporate-PPT main field)

| [`vintage-poster`](./vintage-poster.md) | Mid-century modern poster, halftone + paper grain | Cultural / brand heritage / hospitality / anniversaries |

### 1.4 Specialty

| Rendering | One-liner | Best for |
|---|---|---|

| [`nature`](./nature.md) | Organic earthy illustration | Environment / wellness / sustainability |

### 1.5 Escape hatch — `custom`

Every coordinated Stage-2 direction carries one complete `rendering: custom` candidate even when `recommend.image_usage` does not include `ai`. The UI keeps rendering controls hidden until the current source selection includes AI, then exposes the three already-authored project candidates without another backend recommendation. The 20 fixed renderings remain lower-level single-select alternatives. A template-backed proposal must honor inherited identity and the confirmed template-application plan.

**Hard rule — `rendering_behavior` prose**:

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Length | One paragraph, 2-5 sentences |
| Axes covered | line / texture / depth / material / mood (same as preset files) |
| Catalog basis | Freeze every exact id from this index, then read only those named files before synthesis |

```yaml
- image_rendering: custom
- image_rendering_behavior: "Hand-screened poster aesthetic — slightly misregistered halftone overlays, 3 flat ink colors with visible dot pattern at 12% opacity, no gradients, no anti-aliased edges; reads as silkscreen print."
```

**Hard rule**: three complete rendering candidates are mandatory in every fresh Stage-2 direction set; AI source recommendation remains independent. See [`strategist-image.md`](../strategist-image.md) for the Stage-2 carrier and downstream lock behavior.

Write `image_rendering_references` only when the confirmed custom direction actually uses catalog material. A custom may use zero, one, or many renderings: keep one when it owns the whole specialized treatment, or include every rendering that contributes a distinct executable job across line, texture, depth, material, or mood. Reference count has no fixed cap; count is an outcome, not a target. A four-basis direction may assign `vector-illustration` to silhouette clarity, `minimalist-swiss` to negative-space composition, `screen-print` to restrained halftone texture, and `warm-scene` to light and mood; list all four ids. Omit every rendering whose contribution cannot be stated and never add a second merely to imply synthesis. A genuinely new rendering with no catalog source omits the field and proceeds from its standalone behavior; never invent a reference merely to legitimize `custom`.

## 2. Auto-selection table — `design_spec` → rendering

Match `design_spec.md d` (mode + `visual_style`) against this table. First match wins. **No row matches** → use `custom` per §1.5 rather than force-fitting `vector-illustration`. (When the locked `visual_style` names a paired rendering, prefer that for aesthetic alignment.)

| `d. Style` signal | Recommended rendering | Alternates |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic / MBB / board | `editorial` or `vector-illustration` | `blueprint`, `minimalist-swiss` |
| Corporate report / analysis | `vector-illustration` | `flat`, `digital-dashboard` |
| High-end consulting / luxury / 高端 / design-firm | `minimalist-swiss` | `editorial`, `vector-illustration` |
| Tech / SaaS / AI / system / architecture | `3d-isometric`, `blueprint`, or `digital-dashboard` | `flat`, `vector-illustration` |
| Modern SaaS / fintech / health-tech / premium app | `glassmorphism` | `digital-dashboard`, `flat` |
| Product launch / brand / marketing | `flat`, `3d-isometric`, or `corporate-photo` | `vector-illustration` |
| Education / training / onboarding / 教学 | `sketch-notes` | `vector-illustration` (if school is corporate), `paper-cut` |
| Children / story / storybook / 儿童 | `fantasy-animation` | `paper-cut`, `watercolor`, `sketch-notes` |
| Cultural / folk / festival / 文化 / 节日 | `paper-cut` | `vintage-poster`, `screen-print` |
| Methodology / Before-After / manifesto / 方法论 | `ink-notes` | `editorial` |
| Government / formal / official report | `editorial` or `corporate-photo` | `vector-illustration` |
| Finance / data journalism / 财经 | `editorial` or `digital-dashboard` | `vector-illustration` |
| Personal story / 个人成长 / lifestyle | `watercolor`, `warm-scene` | `corporate-photo`, `paper-cut` |
| Cultural / media / opinion / cinematic | `screen-print`, `vintage-poster` | `editorial`, `warm-scene` |
| Brand heritage / hospitality / 老字号 / 周年 | `vintage-poster` | `screen-print`, `editorial` |
| Gaming / retro / 8-bit / 复古 | `pixel-art` | `vintage-poster` |
| Environment / wellness / 环保 / 户外 | `nature` | `watercolor`, `paper-cut` |

## 3. How to use

1. From `design_spec.md` extract `d. Style` mode + descriptor.
2. Find the matching row above; pick the primary recommendation.
3. For a preset, read `image-renderings/<chosen>.md`. For `custom`, read every file named in `image_rendering_references`, then synthesize them under the confirmed behavior; with no references, use the novel behavior directly. Apply the result when assembling prompts per [`image-generator.md`](../image-generator.md) §4.

**Lock for the whole deck.** Don't change rendering between images in the same deck.
