# Executor Shape Composition Grammar

Runtime grammar for Slide-local qualitative relationships built from editable shapes; it is not a diagram/template catalog.

**Load**: Quick reads this grammar once before all SVG authoring and reuses it for every per-page decision. Default loads it before realizing the first page whose Structure decision is yes, then reuses it in that execution context.

**Hard rule — no Structure catalog**: never recall or resolve `structure/<key>`. Compose from authoritative content, §IX relationships, the communication move, and the active visual system.

**Hard rule — not structured PPTX**: this branch owns Slide-local geometry. [`executor-structured.md`](./executor-structured.md) independently owns reusable Master/Layout/placeholders under `pptx_structure.mode: structured`; neither implies the other.

## 1. Relationship Atoms

| Atom | Meaning | Encode with |
|---|---|---|
| `order` | Sequence, progression, or rank | Position, numbering, direction, shared path |
| `link` | Dependency, exchange, influence, transition | Proximity/alignment when unmistakable; otherwise an edge |
| `parent` | One unit governs or decomposes into children | Branching, indentation, nesting, scale |
| `membership` | Units belong to a group, stage, lane, or region | Containment, shared field, band, repetition |
| `contrast` | Peers, states, options, or positions compare | Shared baseline, opposing regions, parallel framing |
| `overlap` | Units share a meaningful subset or duty | Intersecting regions plus a clear common area |

Combine atoms as needed; never force a named business model. Numbers used only as labels do not create a chart. Value-derived position/length/angle/area/radius/width/color routes to [`executor-chart.md`](./executor-chart.md); row-header × column-header facts route to [`executor-table.md`](./executor-table.md). Qualitative lanes use this grammar, but date/duration-driven task-bar `x`/`width` is Gantt Chart geometry.

## 2. Shape Roles and Operations

| Role | Job |
|---|---|
| `field` | Page/local region where a relationship operates |
| `node` | Semantic unit, state, actor, item, or group; may punctuate a drawn carrier as a stop, turn, junction, or bridge |
| `spine` | Explicit/implied scaffold or continuous carrier establishing reading direction |
| `edge` | Necessary semantic connection, branch, dependency, or transition |
| `label` | Text/evidence attached directly or by a non-relational leader/tether to a node, edge, region, or relationship |
| `garnish` | Non-semantic accent added after the relationship works |

| Operation | Job |
|---|---|
| `repeat` | Create peers from one visual family; clone the full contour only when their structural states match |
| `arrange` | Establish order, alignment, rhythm, rank, comparison |
| `transform` | Vary scale, rotation, crop, fill, emphasis, or entry/continuation/turn/terminal port state meaningfully |
| `connect` | Add an edge when layout/containment is insufficient |
| `region` | Partition, contain, intersect, band, or layer fields |
| `attach` | Bind labels, badges, annotations, or evidence to an owner |

**Hard rule — realization enters the construction gate**: Decide whether each
role is implicit/direct content or drawn geometry. Every drawn field, spine,
node carrier, or edge uses the first faithful tier under
[`native-shape-authoring.md`](./native-shape-authoring.md) §1: primitive → exact
preset → Boolean → necessary freeform. Text styling/rules cannot replace
required geometry; implicit/direct roles need no container. Decoration cannot
invent a relationship.

## 3. Construction Order

Choose the field and map required atoms, then follow:

**Mandatory — spine/topology → nodes → connectors → labels → garnish**:

| Layer | Completion evidence |
|---|---|
| `spine` | Entry, direction, and organizing path are clear; reversal, cycle, split/merge, or stage change reshapes a continuous carrier before node placement |
| `nodes` | Every required unit has one home and intentional weight; each is direct content or a §2-approved carrier; carrier-crossing nodes intentionally continue, stop, turn, join, or bridge its visible path |
| `connectors` (`edge`) | Only unresolved semantic links become edges; route/source/target is clear; every drawn edge passes §2 |
| `labels` | Copy and caveats visibly attach directly or by leader/tether to what they explain; when a node has multiple text roles, cue → claim/value → support → note remains perceptibly descending and absent roles stay absent |
| `garnish` | Removing accents leaves all meaning intact |

**Hard rule — relationship before styling**: establish atoms, field, spine, nodes, and necessary edges before palette, type, effects, or containers. Prefer containment, alignment, baselines, and proximity; add lines/Connectors only for real edges, never to make a page look process-like.

**Default — visible structural composition (may override for naked-text
rhythm/style)**: Make one relationship-bearing field, spine, node carrier, or
directional shape the page-scale move; never add geometry merely because
Structure is `yes`. When drawn roles interact, resolve relationship-bearing
parent contour/direction → contact → joint or intentional void →
z-order/occlusion → canvas-edge behavior before labels/garnish. Skip
inapplicable operations; implicit/direct roles remain container-free.

## 4. Validation

| Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Coverage | Every authoritative atom is visible; none was invented |
| Reading path | Entry, progression, hierarchy, and endpoint are unambiguous |
| Roles | Nodes/edges have one duty; garnish carries no meaning |
| Attachment | Labels/evidence belong to the correct node, edge, or region |
| Removal | Without color/effects/icons/garnish, placement still communicates |
| Fidelity | All required units, qualifiers, values, and caveats remain |
| Construction | Drawn fields/spines/node carriers/edges pass §2; implicit/direct roles need no carrier; freeform follows failed primitive/preset/Boolean tiers |
| Composition | Every used contact, void, overlap, cutout, occlusion, or canvas-edge crossing maps to an atom/role or remains removable garnish; none obscures ownership or reading path |

Load Chart/Table branches independently for embedded objects. Keep one dominant reading path while allowing secondary atoms whose ownership stays clear.
