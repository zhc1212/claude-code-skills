# Strategist Image Planning

Always-on Stage-2 rendering-candidate extension plus conditional formula assets, confirmed image elaboration, and `design_spec.md §VIII` resource planning.

**Trigger**: Load before every fresh Stage-2 direction set. Apply §2 first from the rendering index, freeze each direction's exact bases, and only then read the deduplicated selected detail files before completing its behavior. [`strategist.md`](./strategist.md) independently owns source recommendation. A confirmed non-`none` source activates the applicable resource-planning sections; confirmed `none` without formulas stops before resources, while a formula-only path applies §3 and §4 formula rows only. Rendering candidates are authored once before confirmation and never backfilled from a later source toggle.

## 1. Proposed and Confirmed Image Plan

Before Stage 2, construct rendering candidates independently of the proposed source set. After confirmation, map the confirmed source set through [`strategist.md`](./strategist.md) §h and honor explicit `image_notes` roles; this module never adds a source. The confirmed non-`none` set is an allowed acquisition boundary, not coverage: use a suitable subset and leave irrelevant sources unused. Explicit must-use sources, assets, or page roles remain required. Asset inventory and judgment determine unconfirmed count, subject, placement, and composition without substituting an unconfirmed source.

For illustration, apply this precedence: confirmed `none` → explicit user intent → the locked visual style's `Illus.` propensity (`core` / `supportive` / `sparse`) → none. Propensity controls the lean, not the source or a page quota. When illustration is active, prefer one coherent motif family across hero/section anchors and local spots, but only when the confirmed assets can form that family.

**Context-first understanding for provided assets**: Do not visually scan `images/`. First infer identity, role, and crop / focus needs from source position and surrounding prose, captions / alt / titles, filename, user notes / confirmed `image_notes`, existing resource records, and CSV geometry. Inspect only one specific image when a remaining ambiguity would change selection, factual identity, page role, crop safety, or focal placement. Never inspect for inspiration, bulk-open the folder, or infer external facts / provenance from pixels. Record the result in §VIII. Leave an optional unresolved asset unused; route an unresolved must-use asset through failure recovery.

**Default — one coherent sheet for compatible same-family spots (may override when aspect, detail, quality, or semantic needs differ)**: prefer one Illustration Sheet when several AI-generated spots can share a useful cell shape and production treatment; generate them independently when forcing one sheet would weaken a planned element. When a sheet is chosen, plan one unplaced `ai` Illustration Sheet row plus one placed `slice` row per used element; only slice rows enter `spec_lock.md images`. State the intended placement shape family in the sheet reference and use separate sheets for incompatible shapes. [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) §4.3 owns grid, ratio, slicing, and execution details. Final Stage 2 chooses the AI execution path under `image-generator.md` §7; do not pre-empt or re-pick it here.

**Mandatory — image-treatment path scan, not a quota**: Per selected image choose `none` (unchanged), `native` (SVG crop/clip, transform, opacity, frame/depth, overlap), or `prepared derivative` (separate pixel blur/tone or cutout/registered layers); `none` is valid.

When a subject crosses a native title, panel, frame, or shape, the prepared path is mandatory: plan a clean full-canvas base plus minimum registered RGBA layers; set full-canvas members `no-crop`; name their shared source/registration in `Reference`; suggest `#A2-03`. A shared plate requires padded-bbox-disjoint objects and independent final crops. Use `user` only when every final asset is supplied, otherwise `ai`; [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) §4.4 owns preparation. An independent floating cutout may use `#A2-01`.

## 2. AI Image Strategy — always propose three; lock only for confirmed `ai`

Before any rendering detail, read only [`image-renderings/_index.md`](./image-renderings/_index.md). First author exactly three complete, project-fit solution intents; use the index to freeze each intent's exact rendering bases, then read once only the deduplicated referenced sibling files. Project one complete `image_strategy` into each direction regardless of `recommend.image_usage`. Every candidate carries localized `name`, `rendering: custom`, `visual`, `mood`, and non-empty localized `behavior`. Mood includes a recognizable real-world analogy. All three must credibly serve their owning whole solution, but they need not use different bases or span artificial safe / shifted / bold extremes. Image colors always inherit that direction's deck HEX roles; never add an image palette or alter deck colors to rescue a rendering.

Every direction is a `custom` rendering. It may use zero, one, or many index-selected bases: one may own a specialized treatment, while several must each own a distinct line, texture, depth, material, or mood contribution. Name every actual id in the visible behavior and read only those files after selection; reference count has no fixed cap, and a second basis is never required. If the direction is genuinely novel, name no basis and read none. Under a template it obeys inherited identity and application. Only a confirmed custom locks its edited behavior as `image_rendering_behavior`; when catalog material is actually used, also project the exact ids as `image_rendering_references`, otherwise omit that field. Unselected candidates remain recommendation-only. Do not write a separate fourth `custom_candidates.image_strategy`; ignore legacy `image_palette`.

The UI hides these candidates while AI is not selected. If the user adds AI, it reveals the already-authored three without another backend recommendation; source selection never creates or rewrites rendering candidates. After confirmation, Image_Generator reads only the selected preset or exact custom references and must not blend unselected candidate identities.

For specialized or regulated paper-figure subjects, preserve the prompt depth required by [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) §4.2 rather than shortening to a generic brief. Scan the outline for genuine image-led pages, list the proposed hero pages in Stage-2 `image_notes` so the user can retain, edit, or remove them in the same confirmation, then mark only the confirmed pages' AI rows `page_role: hero_page`; local is the default. `text_policy: embedded` is reserved for stable figure-internal identifiers or lettering deliberately fused into the artwork; page titles, editable data values/labels, and prose remain SVG. Resolve confirmed provided assets through the context-first boundary above before writing §VIII.

## 3. Formula Asset Policy

Formula rendering is a conditional choice surfaced in final Stage 2 production confirmation. Recommend one policy and let the user confirm or override it:

| Policy | Behavior | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `mixed` (default) | Render complex expressions to PNG; keep simple inline math as editable text / Unicode | Most academic, engineering, educational, and technical decks |
| `render-all` | Render every formula-worthy expression to PNG | Formula-heavy teaching / research decks where consistency matters more than editability |
| `text-only` | Keep expressions as editable text / Unicode | Business decks, light technical briefs, or an explicit editability preference |

`$...$` / `$$...$$` in source material are input signals only. Never scan output files for dollar-delimited formulas. Fractions, radicals, integrals, sums, limits, matrices, multiline derivations, and complex super/subscripts are formula-worthy; short variables, simple assignments, percentages, and expressions such as `O(n log n)` normally remain text. Never invent an equation for decoration.

For `mixed` or `render-all`, write selected source expressions to `<project_path>/images/formula_manifest.json` before writing the final spec, then run:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/latex_render.py <project_path>
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images
```

Follow `latex_render.py --help` for the manifest fields. The renderer writes dimensions, ratio, file, provider, and status back into it. Formula PNGs default to transparent; use an opaque final background only when the asset requires it.

## 4. Image Resource List

Add §VIII rows only for planned images and every selected formula; permitted unused sources create no row. Fill filename, dimensions/ratio, layout suggestion, crop, purpose/type, acquisition, status, reference, and conditional AI fields. `Acquire Via` is `ai`, `web`, `user`, `formula`, `placeholder`, or `slice`; status follows [`svg-image-embedding.md`](./svg-image-embedding.md). Keep any unavailable planned/required asset `Pending` or `Needs-Manual`; never delete or reclassify it to appear complete. After final confirmation, project each placed row into `spec_lock.md images` as `<path> | source=<Acquire Via> | pattern=<Layout pattern> | crop=<adaptive|no-crop>` and omit unplaced source/sheet rows. Preserve exact confirmed `source`/`crop`; keep non-empty `pattern`, including optional catalog ids, as preferred expression rather than locked geometry.

**Prepared derivatives**: Keep canonical; `Reference`: `Derived from <bare filename>; treatment=<operation>;`. Deterministic child: distinct `.png`, inherits acquisition; §4.4 follows `user`/`ai` above. Lock placed children; [`image-base.md`](./image-base.md) §2–3 owns preparation.

References describe visual intent: AI uses subject + intent + composition without repeating rendering or HEX; web records exact subject, view/mood, focal/quiet region, and crop safety with positive quality cues; Image_Searcher later derives a separate short, specific provider query without rewriting this locked intent, while complete entity names or necessary disambiguation may use more words; formula preserves source LaTeX and placement intent. Any subject direction, focal placement, quiet region, or overlay-safety requirement that must affect acquisition/generation belongs in `Reference` or the matching §IX block, not only in `Layout pattern`.

**Prepared-user fast path**: For initial imported or user-supplied assets confirmed as `provided`, copy the exact `Filename` basename and derive `Dimensions` / `Ratio` from that row's EXIF-corrected `Width` / `Height` / native `AspectRatio` in the latest `analysis/image_analysis.csv`; `SourceDisplayRatio` is source-context metadata, not the bitmap crop ratio. Drop source-side directories, set `Acquire Via: user` and `Status: Existing`, and decide the remaining §VIII fields normally. Existing §VIII / lock / provenance-manifest records override this inference. Assets declared as `ai`, `web`, `slice`, `formula`, or manual fulfillment retain that provenance and advance through their own status lifecycle after entering `images/`; location never reclassifies them as `user / Existing`.

**Mandatory**: each placed row, including formulas, gets one executable `Layout pattern`. It is preferred expression, not locked geometry; optional hierarchical ids from the already-read [`image-layout-patterns.md`](./image-layout-patterns.md) must be exact. They are prompt lookup handles for Executor, not exporter effect codes. Executor may adapt the suggestion while preserving resource identity/source, must-use status, crop/content, and explicit user/template constraints; layout-only changes need no upstream rewrite.

**Default — action-bearing image plan (may override when restraint better serves the page)**: For a `hero_page` or other image-led row, name an image/content or image/shape action—not position, size, crop, or legibility scrim alone. Plain split and full bleed remain valid when clearest.

Choose narrative intent before dimensions, then apply the already-read [`image-layout-spec.md`](./image-layout-spec.md) to the actual page region. Techniques needing a cutout, blurred crop, or desaturated copy require that prepared asset. Write `Crop Policy: no-crop` whenever cropping could remove required pixels, labels, evidence, identity, or edge content; screenshots, charts, certificates/contracts, dense diagrams, logos, product markings, and formulas are common triggers rather than an exhaustive list. Otherwise write `Crop Policy: adaptive`: Executor may use complete display or a focal-safe crop, and the value never commands cropping. Formula rows use `Type: Latex Formula`, `Acquire Via: formula`, `Crop Policy: no-crop`, and `Rendered` or `Needs-Manual`.

Judge `text_policy` per AI row using [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) §5.3; paper figures, academic schematics, panel comparisons, and data-axis graphics are positive triggers for reconsidering an all-`none` plan. Step 5 dispatches pending `ai` / `slice` rows to Image_Generator and pending `web` rows to Image_Searcher; formula rows bypass both.
