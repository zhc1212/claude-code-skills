# Page Transitions & Per-Element Animations

Execution contract for generated-PPTX **page transitions** and **per-element
object animations**, including deterministic Morph object pairing. This file
owns defaults, sidecar semantics, anchor selection, validation, and package
read-back.

## Capability Menu — Open Here

Motion here is several separate capabilities, not one dial. Two of them are
decided **upstream, while pages are still being authored** — read this menu
before the page plan is frozen, not only when a deck is already exported.

| What the deck needs | Reach for | Decided at |
|---|---|---|
| A generic deck-wide entrance build | `-a auto`; with the default `after-previous` Start mode, groups use fixed `--animation-stagger` timing rather than narration cues | Post-processing; §2, §4 |
| Explicit object lifecycle choreography | An `animations.json` sidecar for selected enter/emphasize/move/exit/static duties, order, Start mode, and timing | Post-processing; §2, §4, [`customize-animations`](../workflows/stages/customize-animations.md) |
| Object reveals semantically synchronized to recorded narration | Narration-cue sync derives `narration_animations.json` from canonical `animations.json`, page-local SRT, and `narration_timing.json`; `-a auto` alone does not provide this mapping | Audio stage; [`generate-audio`](../workflows/stages/generate-audio.md) |
| A continuous action — slide-in, flip, camera push-in, progressive reveal, camera pan | **Morph: author the action as two static pages, then select Morph and add explicit pairs when identity must be deterministic.** There is no keyframe timeline anywhere in this pipeline; the difference between two ordinary editable slides *is* the animation | **Page authoring (Step 6), then motion post-processing** — §2.1, §3.1 |
| A static full-bleed page that should stop looking frozen | Consider slow `path_*` motion on a visually subordinate image or atmospheric layer; §4.1 gives one starting recipe | Post-processing; §4.1 |
| Carousel, counting numerals, parallax depth, click-to-reveal flip card | Four recurring recipes assembled from the mechanisms above | §4.2 — the carousel and odometer both need paired pages |
| Kiosk or unattended playback | `--auto-advance <seconds>`, optionally with `-t none` | Export; §3 |
| A transition or object animation needs an audible cue | Optional `transition.sound` or object-animation `sound`; select it only after the visual motion solution is complete, then sync the chosen global-library ids into the project. For direct narrated MP4 delivery, [`generate-audio`](../workflows/stages/generate-audio.md) selects either the verified native-export mix or explicit real-time slideshow capture; never combine them | Post-motion; §2.2 |
| Nothing should move | `-t none`, and leave per-element animation at its default `none` | Export; §1 |

**Hard rule — Morph geometry is an authoring decision; pairing is a later
execution decision**: export cannot invent the two visible endpoint states.
Author both consecutive pages while `svg_output/` is still being built. For
deterministic identity, expose each endpoint as a compatible direct-root group
and declare the pair in `animations.json` (§2.1); the source and destination ids
and geometry may differ. `-t morph` without explicit pairs leaves matching to
PowerPoint's heuristic and is not proof that the intended objects will tween.

**Reference — not a constraint**: per-element animation stays off by default
(§1). Auto-firing element builds on every page are an unsolicited "AI deck"
tell; each capability above earns its place per page, not per deck.

---

## 1. Defaults

| Layer | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Page transition | CLI: `fade`, 0.4s | Calm baseline that suits most decks; the public Python builder retains its legacy 0.5s default |
| Per-element animation | **`none` (off)** | A page appears as a whole. Auto-firing element builds are an unsolicited "AI deck" tell, so object animation is opt-in. Turn on the content-aware canonical entrance policy with `-a auto`, or select one PowerPoint-native `entrance_*`, `emphasis_*`, `path_*`, or `exit_*` key explicitly |
| Sound effects | **`none` (off)** | No global sound is copied and no `<project>/sounds/` directory is created unless a resolved transition or object-animation cue actually selects one |

To regenerate a deck with different settings, rerun the final checker when its current matching report is absent or stale, then rerun `svg_to_pptx.py` against the same `svg_output/`; the content-generation LLM need not rerun unless authored SVG requires repair. `-s final` is reserved for diagnostic comparison and is not a supported release source. To turn per-element animation on for the whole deck, pass `-a auto`.

---

## 2. Custom Object-Level Animation

Per-element animation is off by default. To enable generic entrance reveals
deck-wide, pass `-a auto` at export (no config needed). When a deck instead
needs a specific object lifecycle—for example enter, move, emphasize, then
exit—use the optional `animations.json` sidecar. The SVG remains the visual
source; the custom stage may rewrite its grouping hierarchy, ids, and bounds to
create better semantic anchors without changing visible output, while the
sidecar controls PPTX animation behavior.

Run the [`customize-animations`](../workflows/stages/customize-animations.md)
post-processing stage when the project already carries `animations.json`, when
the user explicitly asks to tune animation order/effects/timing/object-level
reveals, or when the effective Custom Animations outcome in
`design_spec.md §I` is enabled. A §IX `Motion suggestion` remains Strategist
advice and informs an active pass, but never triggers the stage alone.

**Hard rule — semantic anchors before object-targeted sidecar entries**: when
object animation is in scope, derive motion units and their lifecycle duties
from page meaning and narration, then regroup coarse/fragmented Slide-local
content without changing its appearance. Only post-regroup top-level ids are
valid object targets.

```bash
# Inspect the real anchors after the semantic regrouping pass
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py list-groups <project>

# Build a neutral editable scaffold from the post-regroup anchors when useful
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py scaffold <project>

# Validate references before export
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py validate <project>

# Export reads <project>/animations.json automatically when present
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project>
```

The scaffold keeps `defaults.animation.effect: none` and may list untouched
groups as empty `{}` placeholders; creating it does not opt the deck into
object motion. Populate only adopted motion units.

Sparse sidecar excerpt (unlisted slides inherit resolved defaults):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "slides": {
    "03_threshold": {
      "groups": {
        "risk-marker": {
          "effects": [
            { "effect": "entrance_fade", "order": 1, "duration": 0.25 },
            { "effect": "path_right", "effect_options": { "relative": true }, "order": 2, "duration": 0.7 },
            { "effect": "emphasis_teeter", "order": 3, "duration": 0.45 },
            { "effect": "exit_fade", "order": 4, "duration": 0.3 }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `slides` keys match SVG stems (`03_market.svg` → `03_market`).
- `groups` keys match top-level `<g id="...">` anchors.
- A populated group block chooses exactly one representation: the
  backward-compatible single-effect object, or
  `{ "effects": [row, ...] }`. `effects` is non-empty and mutually exclusive
  with every legacy single-effect field; each row explicitly names `effect`.
  An untouched scaffold `{}` remains a neutral placeholder.
- `effect: none` in the legacy form removes that group from the object-animation
  sequence and is useful for overriding inherited generic animation.
- `effects[]` permits the same PowerPoint shape to carry several Animation Pane
  rows. `order` sorts ordinary rows across the slide; ties retain SVG group
  order and then array order. `trigger_shape` rows keep that relative ordering
  in separate interactive sequences rather than interleaving with the main
  sequence. Ordering never changes slide layering.
- `delay` is seconds added to that row's resolved Start.
- `trigger` may be set per legacy row or `effects[]` row; otherwise it inherits
  the resolved slide Start mode.
- `trigger_shape` is a row-specific reference to another unique, triggerable
  top-level group. It maps to PowerPoint **Trigger → On Click of**, makes only
  that row interactive, and uses `delay` as `TriggerDelayTime`. It implies
  `on-click`; an explicit row `trigger` may accompany it only when also
  `on-click`.
- `duration` overrides the per-row schedule duration. `entrance_appear`
  remains a 1ms visibility flip, and instantaneous native emphasis presets
  retain their PowerPoint-authored duration; the configured value still spaces
  the next `after-previous` row.
- `effect_options` requires an explicit canonical `effect` in the same legacy
  block or `effects[]` row and accepts only parameters PowerPoint exposes for
  that effect:

  | Option | Applies to |
  |---|---|
  | `direction` | Directional Fly/Crawl/Wipe/Peek/Strips/Split/Stretch/Zoom and related entrance/exit effects |
  | `amount` | Wheel spokes (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `8`), emphasis Spin degrees, or Transparency ratio |
  | `color` | Color-capable emphasis effects; `#RRGGBB` or `theme:<scheme-color>` |
  | `font_name` | Change Font; required for `emphasis_change_font`; one installed PowerPoint face, not a CSS list |
  | `size` | Grow/Shrink |
  | `relative` | Motion paths (`true` = shape-relative, `false` = fixed slide path) |
- Any animation block or effect row may set `repeat_count` or `repeat_duration`
  (mutually exclusive), `auto_reverse`, `rewind`, `accelerate`, `decelerate`,
  `bounce_end`, `restart`, `after_effect`, and `sound`. Ratios are `0..1`;
  `bounce_end` requires an interpolated behavior and cannot combine with
  `decelerate`; `restart` is `always`, `when-not-active`, or `never`;
  `after_effect` is `none`, `dim` (with `color`), `hide`, or
  `hide-on-next-click`; `sound` is a project-relative or absolute `.m4a`,
  `.mp3`, or `.wav` path. New generated configurations use a project-relative
  path. A bundled library choice first follows §2.2 and resolves to a
  project-local `.wav`; never point new output at `templates/sounds/`.
- `Speed` and smooth start/end are not duplicate sidecar fields: they are
  derived from `duration` and `accelerate`/`decelerate`.
- This is the complete parameter surface for the generated top-level-group
  target model, including multiple ordered effects on one group. PowerPoint
  paragraph/text-range build fields are intentionally absent because grouped
  SVG content is not emitted as paragraph builds; media play/pause/stop
  commands remain in the audio/video workflows.
- Run `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/pptx_animations.py --describe
  <canonical_effect>` for that effect's exact option values and full parameter
  contract.
- `--animation none` overrides the sidecar and disables all per-element animation.
- An explicit sidecar group may override the legacy chrome-name heuristic, but it cannot override `data-pptx-layer` or an explicit static role/placeholder marker.
- Unknown effects, modes, or triggers and invalid numeric/order fields fail validation; no fallback effect is substituted.

**Inheritance**: the sidecar and its `defaults` block are optional. Unlisted
slides and omitted slide fields inherit `defaults.transition` /
`defaults.animation`, then CLI/exporter resolution. Explicit CLI flags override
the corresponding sidecar default/slide fields; explicit group overrides remain
unless `-a none` hard-disables all object motion. Groups inherit the resolved
slide duration, Start mode, timing modifiers, after-effect, and sound into each
legacy or `effects[]` row. `effect_options` remains coupled to an explicit
effect; `trigger_shape` is never inherited; omitted `order`/`delay` use
exporter defaults.

### 2.1 Deterministic Morph Object Pairing

When one semantic object continues across two adjacent slides, the destination
slide may declare explicit forced-Morph pairs. This is separate from `groups`:
Morph owns cross-slide identity, while `groups` owns Animation Pane rows.
The generated names follow Microsoft's
[forced object-matching convention](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/morph-transition-tips-and-tricks).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "slides": {
    "02_detail": {
      "transition": {
        "effect": "morph",
        "effect_options": { "morph_by": "object" },
        "duration": 0.8
      },
      "morph": {
        "from": "01_overview",
        "pairs": {
          "hero-image": {
            "from": "hero-overview",
            "to": "hero-detail"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `morph` belongs to the destination slide. `morph.from` must be the
  immediately preceding SVG stem in export order.
- `animation_config.py scaffold` never guesses cross-slide identity. Add pairs
  from the semantic motion plan after inspecting the final direct-root ids.
- Each `pairs` key is a stable identity; its `from` and `to` values are unique
  direct-root `<g id>` values on the source and destination slides. Supply the
  key without `!!`; export writes the PowerPoint Selection Pane name
  `!!<key>` on both objects.
- A destination with explicit pairs must explicitly set `effect: morph`.
  `morph_by` may be omitted for its `object` default or set to `object`;
  `word`/`character` are rejected. A CLI transition override that changes the
  resolved effect fails export.
- A middle slide may continue the same object into another Morph transition,
  but the same group must retain the same key. One key cannot name two objects
  on one slide, and one object cannot carry two keys. Every `!!` key shared by
  two adjacent Morph pages must be declared in that destination's `pairs`;
  undeclared forced matches are rejected.
- Explicit pairing can coexist with in-slide object animation and remains
  active when `-a none` disables Animation Pane rows. `--no-animations`
  disables the sidecar and all page/object motion.
- The exporter resolves both group ids to final Slide-local PowerPoint shapes,
  writes names only after Master/Layout processing, then reopens the package
  and verifies adjacency, Morph by object, one name per slide, and matching
  OOXML object types. Missing, structural, moved, ambiguous, or mismatched
  targets fail instead of falling back to automatic Morph matching.

### 2.2 On-Demand Sound Selection

**Hard rule — select after motion, materialize after selection**: sound is not a
Strategist resource and does not belong in `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`, or
pre-SVG resource preparation. First complete the SVG roster and resolve the
transition/object-motion solution. Only when a specific cue is then selected,
copy its global-library file into the project and reference that local copy.

| Source | Action |
|---|---|
| Bundled CC0 library | Discover ids with `sound_sync.py list`, sync only the selected ids, then use the corresponding `sounds/<namespace>/<file>.wav` paths |
| User-provided audio already inside the project | Reference its existing project-relative `.m4a`, `.mp3`, or `.wav` path for object animation; a transition sound uses `.wav` |
| External absolute file | The low-level object-animation path remains compatible, but new generated projects should copy or sync the intended file into the project and use a relative path |
| No concrete auditory cue job | Keep `sound` omitted; do not create `<project>/sounds/` and do not copy the library |

```bash
# Inspect ids only after the visual motion solution exists
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/sound_sync.py list
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/sound_sync.py list --query <term>

# Materialize only the chosen ids
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/sound_sync.py \
  <project_path> <namespace>/<sound_id> [<namespace>/<sound_id> ...]
```

`sound_sync.py` is the only bundled-library materialization path. Stable ids
include their namespace; copied files remain under
`<project_path>/sounds/<namespace>/`. The exporter never reads the global
`templates/sounds/` library directly, and sidecars store paths rather than
library ids.

**Default — silence (may override for a specific cue)**: do not add sound to
demonstrate capability or spread it across a deck for coverage. A sound may
support a named transition, reveal, confirmation, warning, or drawn/moving
gesture after the corresponding visual behavior is already selected.

**Hard rule — PPTX and MP4 are separate sound deliveries**: sound fields and
package read-back prove the editable PPTX contains the intended native cue;
they do not prove PowerPoint's video encoder placed it in the MP4 audio track.
For direct narrated MP4 delivery with resolved cues, follow `generate-audio`
and choose exactly one branch: mix from the final narrated trace plus final
PPTX after native encoding, or explicitly capture the live PowerPoint Slide
Show with system audio. Never mix the capture again. Keep post-production gain
and limiter settings out of `animations.json`.

## 3. Page Transitions

**Reference — not a constraint**: choose a transition from the relationship
between adjacent pages, not from gallery coverage. Run this playbook before
selecting a canonical key:

| Pass | Decision |
|---|---|
| Relate | Decide whether the destination continues the same object or space, advances in a meaningful direction, opens a new section, or intentionally breaks continuity. |
| Diagnose | Name the transition's job: neutral continuity, immediate cut, directional progress, object/state continuity, spatial movement, or a deliberate thematic beat. |
| Select | Use the smallest family that performs that job; keep `fade` when no stronger relationship exists. |
| Coordinate | Align direction, duration, and recurrence with reading order, narration, and the deck's established motion language. |
| Stop | Keep `fade` or `none` when another effect adds no meaning; never vary transitions for catalog coverage. |

| Page relationship | Candidate family |
|---|---|
| Ordinary continuation within one section | `fade` |
| Immediate change with no continuity to preserve | `none` or `cut` |
| Directional steps, timeline, or layer progression | `push` / `wipe`; use `cover` / `uncover` when an overlay relationship is visible |
| The same semantic object or scene changes across adjacent pages | `morph`; use §2.1 pairs when identity must be deterministic |
| Section opening, key reveal, or marked state boundary | Selective `split` / `reveal` / `shape` / `flash` / `random_bars` |
| A repeated collection advances through one spatial frame | `pan` / `conveyor` / `ferris_wheel`; use the §4.2 Morph carousel when individual cards need deterministic identity |
| The viewpoint travels around or through a continuous space | `rotate` / `window` / `orbit` / `fly_through` |
| The narrative or theme supports a stage, paper, or physical-page metaphor | Selective `fall_over` / `drape` / `curtains` / `wind` / `prestige` / `peel_off` / `page_curl` / `airplane` / `origami` / `doors` |
| A disruptive beat represents breakage, collapse, or dispersal | Selective `fracture` / `crush` / `dissolve` / `vortex` / `shred` |
| A marked reveal benefits from a geometric, timed, or textured pattern | Selective `checkerboard` / `blinds` / `clock` / `ripple` / `honeycomb` / `glitter` / `comb` |
| A card, panel, gallery, or viewpoint visibly turns or changes face | Selective `switch` / `flip` / `gallery` / `cube` / `box` / `zoom` |
| Unpredictability is itself the requested behavior | `random`; never use it merely to create variety |

```bash
# Pick a different effect
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t push --transition-duration 0.6

# Remove the visual transition
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t none

# Auto-advance every 5 seconds (kiosk-style playback)
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> --auto-advance 5

# Auto-advance with no visual transition
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project> -t none --auto-advance 5
```

The native registry covers PowerPoint's complete Subtle, Exciting, and Dynamic
Content gallery: 48 canonical keys. New selection, sidecars, plans, conversion
traces, and writers use only those keys. Run `pptx_animations.py --list` for
the categorized identifiers.

Eight old low-level names remain accepted only as compatibility inputs. They
desugar to a native key plus native `effect_options`: for example, `diamond`
becomes `shape` with `shape: diamond`, and `wedge` becomes `clock` with
`style: wedge`. They are never selected for new output.

Effects expose their real PowerPoint Effect Options through
`transition.effect_options`. Common examples include Push/Wipe direction,
Morph by object/word/character, Reveal through black, Shape geometry, Page
Curl direction/pages, Glitter pattern/direction, and Fly Through bounce. Run
`pptx_animations.py --describe-transition <effect>` for the exact
effect-specific contract; unknown or inapplicable options fail validation.
`none` removes the visual effect. Effects that require newer Office namespaces
carry a real PowerPoint effect in `mc:Choice` and a `fade` fallback for older
consumers; validation requires the requested primary effect and never accepts
the fallback as a silent substitute.

An optional `transition.sound` adds one `.wav` cue to the transition. It is a
sidecar field rather than a CLI flag. Bundled choices must first be synced by
§2.2 and referenced through their project-relative path. `effect: none` may
still carry a transition sound and/or automatic advance without restoring a
visual effect. A slide-level `transition.sound: null` explicitly clears an
inherited default transition sound for that page.

Flags:

- `-t/--transition` — native effect name, compatibility input, or `none` for no visual transition. Default: `fade`. `none` does not remove an explicitly configured automatic advance.
- `--transition-duration` — seconds, default `0.4`.
- `--auto-advance` — seconds; click remains enabled, so the slide advances on click or when the timer expires. Omit for presenter-controlled advance.

**Hard rule — no silent downgrade**: an unknown transition effect, unsupported Effect Option, or invalid/non-finite duration fails export. It is never replaced by `fade`. Recorded narration keeps the resolved visual transition; `-t none --recorded-narration ...` writes narration-driven advance timing without restoring a visual effect.

### 3.1 Morph — author an action as the difference between two pages

Morph tweens objects it can match across consecutive slides. That makes it a general mechanism, not just a transition: **any continuous action can be authored as two static pages plus a Morph transition**, with no keyframe timeline anywhere. Duplicate the page, change one property on one object, and PowerPoint interpolates the rest. Use §2.1 explicit pairs when the match must be deterministic.

| Change between the two pages | Reads as |
|---|---|
| Object sits off-canvas, then on-canvas | Slide-in, drawer pull, card extending |
| Object rotates | Flip, turn, hinge |
| Image container scales up | Camera push-in |
| Scrim opacity drops, or a cut contour grows | Progressive reveal |
| Same wide image at two `x` offsets | Camera pan (see image-layout-patterns `#C2-01`) |

Chain three or more pages to build a sequence — extend, hold, retract — where each page is still an ordinary editable slide.

**Hard rule — matching needs compatible object identity, not identical SVG
geometry**: for generated decks, prefer §2.1 deterministic pairs. The source
and destination direct-root group ids may differ, and position, size, crop, or
other visible state is expected to change; both endpoints must still resolve to
one compatible top-level PowerPoint object kind. Automatic Morph without pairs
is heuristic and may cross-fade instead of tweening.

**Give text somewhere to come from.** Morph tweens objects present on both pages; text that only exists on the second page can only fade in. The standard fix is to place the *next* page's copy on the current page just outside the canvas (below), and the *previous* page's copy just outside the opposite edge (above). Each block then slides through the frame instead of blinking, and the deck reads as one continuous surface being scrolled. A wholly off-canvas endpoint must be one direct-root `<g id>` with valid `data-pptx-bounds` and `data-pptx-morph-staging="true"`; when Morph remains enabled, pair it explicitly under §2.1. The marker only declares an intentional invisible endpoint; it cannot excuse a partially clipped group or text carrier.

**When Morph refuses to match**: PowerPoint pairs compatible object kinds; a
shape and a picture will cross-fade instead of tweening. For generated pages,
declare the identity through the destination slide's `morph` block (§2.1).
The exporter writes the shared `!!<key>` name after structure processing and
reads the package back. Do not author `data-pptx-shape-name` for this purpose;
that attribute remains importer metadata for mirror/preserve packages
([`svg-effects.md`](./svg-effects.md) §6.6).

**Not supported — Slide Zoom / Summary Zoom.** Click-to-jump navigation built on PowerPoint's Zoom objects (the "click a portrait, zoom into that section" pattern) has no exporter path. Build click-driven navigation with `trigger_shape` on ordinary object animations instead, or with plain hyperlinks.

**No 3D**: perspective rotation, extrusion, and shear are outside the SVG contract — `skewX` / `skewY` and shear matrices fail closed ([`svg-effects.md`](./svg-effects.md) §6.8). Build the same impression with 2D means — offset, scale, overlap, and per-facet lightness — rather than attempting a 3D tilt.

---

## 4. Per-Element Animations

Off by default — enable deck-wide with `-a auto` (or another effect). Once enabled, three Start modes are available — these mirror PowerPoint's animation-pane "Start" dropdown:

- **`on-click`** — each click reveals the next group. Use only for a controlled semantic reveal; live delivery alone is insufficient. Forbidden with `--recorded-narration`.
- **`with-previous`** — groups start together as one coordinated beat. Stagger ignored.
- **`after-previous`** (default) — click-free cascade on slide entry with `--animation-stagger` spacing. Use when controlled reveals are unnecessary.

**Default — coherent Start rhythm (may override when a semantic beat needs
different control)**: Keep one dominant deck rhythm and normally one mode per
slide. Mix only for a distinct simultaneous or presenter-controlled beat.

Enable with `-a auto`, select a canonical effect with
`--animation entrance_fade`, and choose Start behavior with
`--animation-trigger on-click|with-previous|after-previous`.

PowerPoint's separate **Trigger → On Click of** behavior uses row-specific
`trigger_shape`. It links that row to another top-level group while unlinked
rows keep the slide Start mode; it is not a fourth deck-wide Start mode.

**Mandatory — lifecycle before effect selection**: start from `static`, then
classify semantic `initial → action → end` before choosing an effect. Generic
staged reveals normally use `enter`; narrower communication jobs select their
matching lifecycle instead.

| Duty | State contract | Use when | Effect family |
|---|---|---|---|
| `static` | present → hold as reference → present | Motion adds no clarity or intended feeling | No row; legacy `effect: none` only suppresses inheritance |
| `enter` | absent → introduce → present | Information should be withheld, ordered, or revealed with narration | `entrance_*`; modes only for generic reveal |
| `emphasize` | present → redirect attention → present/altered | An already visible object must regain attention or show a local change; never substitute for its first reveal | Explicit `emphasis_*` |
| `move` | state/position A → progress → state/position B | The trajectory carries spatial or causal meaning, or §4.1 adopts subordinate ambient motion; use Morph for cross-page continuity | Explicit `path_*`, or endpoint pages + Morph |
| `exit` | present → retire → absent | The same slide must remove, replace, or make room for content; an ordinary page change needs no object exit | Explicit `exit_*` |

**Default — restrained entrance-led choreography (may override for content,
tone, or the request)**: Use entrances for ordinary builds. Add emphasis or
exit sparingly, only for a real duty and fitting effect. Multiple `effects[]`
rows require multiple duties.

The registry exposes two layers:

- **203 PowerPoint-native object presets**: 53 `entrance_*` presets, 33
  `emphasis_*` effects, 64 `path_*` motion paths, and 53 `exit_*` effects.
  Examples include `entrance_bounce`, `emphasis_spin`, `path_circle`, and
  `exit_faded_zoom`. Each native key carries the complete PowerPoint-authored
  behavior tree, not a generic filter approximation.
- **29 legacy compatibility inputs**, listed by `--list`; new output never
  selects them.

Run the registry command for the exact categorized key list:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/pptx_animations.py --list
```

Compatibility names normalize before selection and writing: for example,
`fade` resolves to `entrance_fade`; every old Fly direction name resolves to
`entrance_fly`; every old Wipe direction name resolves to `entrance_wipe`; and
`cut` resolves to `entrance_appear` because current PowerPoint has no separate
Cut object effect. Directional aliases preserve their old direction through
`effect_options`; legacy `wheel` maps to `entrance_wheel` with four spokes.
These names are accepted only as compatibility inputs.
Automatic selection, new sidecars, conversion traces, and writers use
canonical keys.

The native keys mirror the object-capable `MsoAnimEffect` surface. The four
media commands—play, pause, stop, and play from bookmark—are not object effects
for SVG groups and remain owned by the audio/video workflows.

- `auto` handles generic `enter` duties only and maps semantic ids to canonical entrances: charts/tables/timelines use
  `entrance_wipe`; cards/steps use `entrance_fly`; titles/takeaways use
  `entrance_fade`; image-like ids cycle a richer pool; unmatched ids cycle
  fade/wipe/fly/zoom.
- `mixed` (legacy mode name) handles generic `enter` duties only and is
  deterministic. The first animated group on each
  slide uses `entrance_fade`; later groups cycle through a 16-effect canonical
  PowerPoint entrance pool across the deck. The mode name remains compatible;
  it no longer selects hand-authored compatibility rows.
- `random` handles generic `enter` duties only and samples from the same
  canonical PowerPoint entrance pool.
  Resolution is seeded from the effective deck input, so the same input
  produces the same choices; `--conversion-trace` records every resolved effect
  when diagnostics are enabled.

`entrance_appear` is excluded from every variation pool because it has no
visible motion. `auto`, `mixed`, and `random` never satisfy an adopted
`emphasize`, `move`, or `exit` duty; those require explicit canonical effects.

Flags: `-a/--animation` selects effect/mode; `--animation-trigger` selects Start;
`--animation-duration` and `--animation-stagger` control base timing;
`--animation-config` selects a sidecar; `--no-animations` disables page/object
motion but preserves narration audio and recorded advance timing.

> Note: `--recorded-narration` rejects `on-click` and `trigger_shape`. Narration-cue sync uses `narration_animations.json` and blocks when only canonical `animations.json` exists. Narration-independent custom motion explicitly passes `--animation-config animations.json`, even when a derived sidecar also exists. With no sidecar, pass `--inherit-motion-from <base_postflight_report>`; explicit all-motion-off uses `--no-animations`.

### 4.1 Slow ambient motion — the page that breathes

**Reference — not a constraint**: ambient motion can keep a static page from
feeling frozen when it remains visually subordinate to the message. A common
starting recipe is `path_left` or `path_right` on a background image, started
`with-previous` and paced much more slowly than a content reveal. The same
principle may suit another atmospheric or non-information-bearing layer. Choose
duration, distance, and moving-object count from the composition and delivery
context.

Keep a full-bleed moving image covering the canvas at both endpoints; exposing
the slide beneath it is a visible failure.

It pairs naturally with a fixed foreground: with image-layout-patterns `#M1-07`, the scrim and its cut contour stay locked while the world moves behind the cuts, which reads as looking through windows rather than as a sliding photo. The same logic applies to `#M1-10` and `#P1-09`.

Motion remains subordinate: avoid competing ambient paths or movement that
reduces the readability of body copy or data. Multiple coordinated layers are
valid when they express one intentional depth or atmosphere relationship.

### 4.2 Recurring recipes

Four combinations that recur constantly in authored decks. Each is built from
mechanisms already defined above — none needs a new capability.

**Carousel** (Morph, §2.1 and §3.1) — hold a fixed row of card frames and rotate the *content* through them: on each page every image advances one position, so the card at centre changes while the frames stay put. Explicitly pair each moving content unit across adjacent pages; the fixed frames stay static and need no pair. Scales to any number of images with one page each.

**Odometer / counting numerals** (morph or motion path) — build a vertical strip of digits 0–9 and show one through a fixed window formed by background-filled rectangles above and below ([`image-layout-patterns.md`](./image-layout-patterns.md) `#M1-08`). Shift the strip so the target digit lands in the window, then either morph between two pages or run a `path_up` motion on the strip. A small stagger, such as `0.1s`, can make digit columns settle in sequence; synchronized motion is also valid when it fits the intended rhythm.

**Parallax depth** (morph) — move a background layer a *short* distance and a foreground layer a longer one between two pages. The differing travel is read as depth. Keep both layers' z-order identical on both pages; a layer that changes stacking between pages breaks the tween and the transition jumps.

**Flip-card / click-to-reveal** (`trigger_shape`, §4) — pair a face group and a back group at the same position, give the face an exit and the back an entrance, and set the back's `trigger_shape` to the face's id. Clicking the face plays both. This is the supported route for click-driven interaction; PowerPoint's Zoom objects are not (§3.1).

## 5. Anchor Logic — Top-Level `<g id="...">`

Per-element animations are anchored on **top-level `<g id="...">` content
groups** in the SVG (e.g. `<g id="cover-title">`, `<g id="card-1">`). IDs must
be unique within the page. A backward-compatible single-effect group produces
one Animation Pane row; `effects[]` may produce several ordered rows targeting
the same PowerPoint shape. Each row inherits the slide Start mode unless it
declares its own `trigger`. Nested implementation groups may remain anonymous
because the sidecar does not target them.

**Hard rule — existing groups are not custom-animation intent**: the
pre-existing SVG hierarchy is implementation evidence, not an authoritative
motion plan. During the custom-animation stage, derive one group per logical
motion unit from claims, comparisons, sequence, causality, and narration beats;
split coarse wrappers and merge fragmented atoms when needed, then use
`list-groups` only after that rewrite. This is also the granularity PowerPoint
uses for group-select / group-move. Do not split or merge units to hit a target
count.

**Chrome stays static.** `data-pptx-layer` and explicit static
role/placeholder markers are absolute. For marker-free legacy SVGs, chrome-like
ids (background, header/footer, decor, watermark, page number, nav, logo, rule)
are skipped; an explicit sidecar entry may override only this name heuristic.
Keep wrappers and use `effect: none` for static content.

**Fallback for flat SVGs** (no top-level `<g>` wrappers, only raw `<rect>` / `<text>` / `<path>` at the root):

- ≤ 8 visible top-level primitives → each becomes one anchor (capped to avoid 70+ atom cascades on dense pages).
- > 8 → animation is skipped on that slide. The slide still renders, just without object animation.

Executors should wrap logical sections in `<g id>` regardless of whether you plan to animate. [`shared-standards-core.md`](./shared-standards-core.md) requires it.

## 6. Validation and Read-Back

Animation configuration is strict. Export fails on an unknown effect, mode, or
trigger; invalid timing/order values; a missing slide/group/`trigger_shape`
reference; a self-trigger; or any attempt to animate or trigger from a
structural layer. These errors never downgrade or silently omit a target.

Generated export reads each slide's timing tree back and checks row count/order,
including repeated rows on one shape, trigger, trigger shape, shape target,
preset class, resolved effect tuple, native behavior signature, duration, and
timeline offset. Package validation then checks root
timing placement, unique and valid `p:cTn` ids, and every `p:spTgt` reference.
Deterministic Morph additionally checks the final adjacent slide parts for the
requested `!!` names, one-to-one uniqueness, compatible object types, and a
real Morph-by-object transition on the destination.
The writer does not emit `p:bldP` for groups or pictures. Direct-PPTX preserve
mode tolerates unchanged legacy group/picture `p:bldP` rows from earlier PPT
Master exports; new generated packages remain strict.

Narration injection preserves animation and updates both p14 Choice/Fallback
when bounce timing is present; unsupported nested timing fails safely.
Direct-PPTX routes fingerprint source
object-animation timing before and after their allowed edits, then run
structural package validation; they do not author or normalize animation
effects.

**Validation boundary**: these checks prove PPTX timing, relationships, and
embedded sound parts. They are not final-video audio acceptance. The
native-export branch requires a triggered `video_sound_mix.py` receipt; the
slideshow-capture branch requires the human picture/audio/all-cue acceptance
owned by `generate-audio` and never claims that receipt.

## 7. Video Adaptation Contract

Video renderers consume the resolved conversion trace through
`video_motion_plan.py`, never a raw sidecar or delay-only inference. The plan
locks identity, order, effect, direction, and timing; video may refine only its
declared renderer parameters. Unsupported families fail visibly. See
[`video-motion-plan.md`](../scripts/docs/video-motion-plan.md).

On the native-export mix branch, direct narrated video sound uses the final
resolved trace for cue order and offsets, the final PPTX relationships for the
exact embedded audio bytes, and page-level narration correlation for the
exported-video clock. It never reads sound timing from a raw sidecar or
filename. The explicit slideshow-capture branch records PowerPoint's real-time
playback instead and does not consume the trace for sound mixing.

---

## 8. Limitations

- Generated animation belongs to the native PPTX built from `svg_output/`.
  `svg_final/` is a static preview, and inserting it as one SVG picture does
  not create object anchors.
- PowerPoint OOXML is the compatibility target; other presentation apps may
  reinterpret individual native behavior trees.
- PowerPoint's native MP4 encoder may omit transition and object-animation
  sounds even when the PPTX package is valid. Direct sound-enabled MP4 delivery
  therefore uses either the post-export mix or the explicit real-time
  slideshow-capture contract owned by `generate-audio`; the branches never
  stack.
- Direct-PPTX routes preserve unknown transition `AlternateContent`; timing
  edits keep Choice and Fallback advance attributes synchronized.
