# Layout Templates

**Layout = a structure-only reusable template bundle.** It owns canvas,
Master/Layout structure, page types, slot geometry, semantic text roles,
alignment/wrapping/capacity behavior, and the SVG roster. It does not own
brand color, typeface/weight identity, the final resolved type scale, logo,
voice, or icon style. Those identity decisions come from an explicit
brand/deck source or from the Strategist confirmation stage.

A layout may describe the content shapes and delivery conditions its geometry
can support. It must not own a communication objective, audience outcome,
scenario-specific narrative sequence, fixed boilerplate, or example content
that downstream generation is expected to preserve. Those application rules
belong to a Deck. A structurally useful “board update” page can remain a
Layout; a board-update sequence with required decision, risk, and action roles
is a Deck.

Neutral colors, safe fonts, and provisional sizes may appear in SVG prototypes
so the structure is reviewable. They are preview values, not a locked identity
segment or final type scale. The reusable rule is the role hierarchy and its
spatial behavior. When the workspace is used, Strategist inspects the actual
prototypes and current content, decides how much structure to reuse, and writes
the internal exporter plan automatically.

| Axis | Layout behavior |
|---|---|
| Template kind | `layout`: structure only |
| Internal creation strategy | AI derives `standard` / `fidelity` for a new system or `mirror` for validated source-package materialization; the field is tool provenance, not a user choice |
| Application planning | Strategist automatically decides literal, structural, or style-only use and derives any strict/adaptive exporter value |
| PPTX structure | The workspace is `structured`; the derived application plan decides whether generated pages compile its structure or use it only as visual reference |

The discovery source of truth is [`layouts_index.json`](./layouts_index.json)
(`layout_id → { summary, canvas_format, page_count, page_types }`). This README
defines the kind and intentionally does not enumerate installed layouts. The
shared kind and workspace model lives in the parent
[`README.md`](../README.md).

Layout mirror has one additional eligibility rule: the validated source
contract must already be brand-neutral and application-neutral. A source
outside that boundary can become a Layout only through `standard` or
`fidelity`, which deliberately authors a new neutral system. If its identity or
application rules must remain literal, create a Deck instead. Removing either
kind of rule is never a mirror operation.

## Selection and identity boundary

Selection follows the parent README's Default Stage-1
[`generate-pptx`](../../workflows/generate-pptx.md) template-choice contract.
Its Layout choices come only from `layouts_index.json`; no
directory scan or bare-ID/style-phrase match is allowed. A supplied exact root
appears in the same selector, defaults Stage 1 to template mode, and preselects
that specific candidate only when it is the sole supplied root. Registered
exact roots are `library`; other exact roots remain `explicit`.
Choosing and confirming an entry runs the conditional
[`apply-template-workspace`](../../workflows/stages/apply-template-workspace.md)
stage, which owns path normalization, compatibility checks, installation, and
installation after Stage 1 and before Stage 2. Template-aware reading begins in final Stage 2 from the
installed project-local copy.
Quick applies a supplied exact Layout root directly and otherwise uses free
design. It uses installed prototypes as flat authoring inputs; reusable
native Master/Layout compilation remains a default lock-backed capability.
This file owns the Layout schema and its identity/application boundary. Chat
discovery reads the same index and returns exact roots; a bare ID never resolves
implicitly.

## `design_spec.md` contract

The spec stores portable structural metadata plus rules unique to this layout.
It omits the deck-only Template Overview/application contract and every
identity section. The frontmatter `summary` carries the concise selection
context.

```markdown

canvas_format: ppt169
canvas_width: 1280
canvas_height: 720
canvas_viewbox: "0 0 1280 720"

# [Layout Name] — Design Specification

## IV. Signature Design Elements
## V. Page Roster
## VII. Placeholder Overrides      # omit when none
```

`replication_mode` records how the workspace was produced. Create Template
derives it from the natural-language brief and source evidence; users do not
need to select or understand this field.

`Signature Design Elements` describes only reusable structure: grids, zones,
image behavior, density rhythm, semantic text roles, alignment/wrapping/
capacity behavior, and slot conventions. It must not introduce a brand
palette, typeface identity, final type scale, communication objective, or
required narrative sequence. `Page Roster` lists every SVG with its Layout
key, PowerPoint picker name, supported content shape, and slot behavior.

---

## Structured SVG and slot contract

Every SVG is a complete preview and declares one root Master and Layout.
Master/Layout fixed visuals are direct atoms. A reusable slot is a top-level
`<g id>` with positive design-zone bounds and exactly one compatible carrier;
zero-slot Layouts are valid. A typed `picture`, `chart`, or `table` slot does
not by itself promise an inserted picture or native data object: the generated
Slide supplies its content, and Chart/Table native replacement remains an
explicit export choice.

Use canonical `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` names where they fit. A layout with intentional
vocabulary overrides declares a `placeholders:` map in frontmatter. Full rules:
[`template-designer.md`](../../references/template-designer.md#4-placeholder-reference-canonical-convention-overridable-per-template).

`standard` and `fidelity` author new SVGs and a new Master/Layout/slot system.
`mirror` preserves existing source identities, parentage, assignments,
placeholder facts, and supported visuals in a new workspace without semantic
synthesis. Legacy semantic contracts are not upgraded in place; create a new
workspace through [`create-template`](../../workflows/create-template.md). A
flat directory shape alone is not a legacy signal.

## Workspace and creation

```text
<template_workspace>/
├── templates/                # design_spec.md + SVG prototypes
├── images/                   # optional bitmaps; SVG href is ../images/<name>
├── icons/
│   └── imported/             # optional canonical imported vectors
└── exports/                  # review evidence; ignored during template use
    └── <layout_id>_template_preview.pptx
```

Library scope writes `skills/ppt-master/templates/layouts/<layout_id>/` and
updates the index. Project scope uses an initialized `projects/<name>/`
workspace and does not register globally. Empty optional directories are
omitted.

1. Enter [`workflows/create-template.md`](../../workflows/create-template.md), which dispatches structure-only output to [`create-layout.md`](../../workflows/create-template/create-layout.md).
2. Validate with `svg_quality_checker.py --template-mode`.
3. Run `template_preview_pptx.py` when review is requested and always when the roster declares multiple Masters.
4. In library scope, register with `register_template.py <id> --kind layout`.

General SVG/PPT rules remain authoritative in
[`shared-standards-core.md`](../../references/shared-standards-core.md) and
[`pptx-structure-interface.md`](../../references/pptx-structure-interface.md).
See [`styles/`](../styles/) when reusable method and visual direction should be
combined with this structure without becoming identity truth.
