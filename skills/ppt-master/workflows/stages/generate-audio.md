# Generate Audio Stage

> Shared narration stage. Run after the owning route's notes step. Edge, ElevenLabs, MiniMax, and timestamp-capable CosyVoice produce per-slide audio/SRT from synthesis timing. Qwen is audio-only because its TTS API exposes no timing. The caller owns final PPTX integration.

This stage is **context-independent**: it reads `notes/*.md` and queries the selected TTS voice catalog, so either owning route may invoke it in a fresh session. It does not choose the top-level route and does not patch slide design.

**Trigger**: In Generate PPTX, run when the effective `Narration Audio` outcome
in `design_spec.md` §I is `enabled`; a later explicit request first updates that
outcome and its provenance. Quick Generate instead runs when the request or
current agent's active-context decision selects narration. In Enhance Native
PPTX, run when its confirmed enhancement plan has `audio.enabled: true`.

**Hard dependency — speaker notes**: Audio requires complete per-slide speaker
notes. Generate PPTX additionally requires its effective `Speaker Notes`
outcome to be enabled; Enhance Native PPTX follows its confirmed notes/audio
plan, where enabling audio also enables notes. Quick records the same dependency
in active context. Do not enter audio generation while the owning route's notes
are missing or incomplete; generate and validate those notes first, then resume
this stage.

## When to Run

- Per-page narration files exist at `notes/*.md`. In Generate PPTX, split `notes/total.md` during Step 7.1. In Enhance Native PPTX, the notes module writes numeric files such as `001.md`.
- Default mode: `edge-tts` is installed (`python3 -m pip install edge-tts`).
- The stage is page-level only: one note becomes `audio/<stem>.<audio-ext>` plus `audio/<stem>.srt` on provider-timed paths, or one audio file with Qwen / explicit CosyVoice audio-only mode. Never substitute one long track or automatic splitting.
- Final/literal script notes are synthesized verbatim. Source SRT timecodes are pacing evidence only; new provider timing owns the generated audio/SRT set.
- SRT bound to an authoritative existing recording does not enter TTS. Recorded narration requires page-level audio or an explicit page/time map; automatic long-track splitting is unsupported.
- A fully successful run writes a compact `audio/manifest.json` with only provider/model, audio/subtitle format, relevant voice settings, and a SHA-256 fingerprint instead of the raw cloud voice ID. It has no per-slide inventory, artifact hashes, or API keys and is not a normal generation input. The flat `audio/` directory is the single active narration set; do not create provider subdirectories unless the user explicitly asks to preserve multiple variants.
- PPT narration assets must be PowerPoint-reliable audio: `m4a` (AAC), `mp3`, or `wav`. The built-in TTS path defaults to `mp3`; provider formats such as `pcm`, `opus`, or `flac` must be transcoded before embedding.
- PowerPoint recorded narration export requires `ffprobe` so slide timings can be written from actual audio duration.
- Optional automatic video export requires Windows PowerPoint 2016+ and runs
  through `powerpoint_video.py`; the command waits for PowerPoint's native
  encoder to finish before returning.
- Optional slideshow capture is an explicit manual Windows PowerPoint handoff;
  it is never an automatic fallback or project dependency.
- macOS PowerPoint may export MP4/MOV manually, but it has no equivalent
  `CreateVideo` automation contract and its movie export does not preserve
  animation effects. Do not replace the missing API with UI scripting.
- Optional post-export video calibration requires `ffmpeg` plus `numpy`; it runs only after a finished PowerPoint video is supplied or created.
- Direct MP4 delivery with resolved transition/object-animation sound cues also
  requires `ffmpeg` plus `numpy`. It renders an independent SFX stem, mixes it
  after native PowerPoint export, and validates the actual mixed audio track.
- High-quality cloud mode: provider API key is set before use:
  - ElevenLabs: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
  - MiniMax: `MINIMAX_API_KEY`
  - Qwen: `QWEN_API_KEY` or `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`
  - CosyVoice: `COSYVOICE_API_KEY` or `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`
  - Keys may live in the current process environment or the first `.env` found in this order: current working directory, skill directory (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/ppt-master/.env`), clone repo root, `~/.ppt-master/.env`
- The deck is in a single dominant language (mixed-language decks: pick the dominant one — the AI uses judgment, not a heuristic).

If per-slide notes are missing, recover through the owning route. Generate
PPTX returns to its enabled notes branch and then runs
`total_md_split.py <project_path>`; Enhance Native PPTX returns to
`native-enhance-pptx` Step 6 and writes numeric notes directly. Never run the
Generate splitter against a Native Enhance project.

---

## Step 1: Determine the deck's language

The AI already knows the deck's language from writing the notes. No detection script needed.

- Identify the primary language from the notes content: `zh` / `en` / `ja` / `ko` / etc.
- For mixed-language decks (e.g. Chinese with English technical terms), pick the language the audience will hear most of.
- For Chinese specifically: pick the locale based on context — `zh-CN` (mainland mandarin, default), `zh-TW` (Taiwanese mandarin), or `zh-HK` (Cantonese). Default Generate may ask when context is unclear; Quick chooses the best supported default and continues.

---

## Step 2: Choose audio backend and pull the voice catalog

Default to **edge** unless the user explicitly asks for a cloud provider / higher-quality cloud narration / a cloned voice.

**edge backend**:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/notes_to_audio.py --list-voices --locale <locale>
```

**ElevenLabs backend**:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/notes_to_audio.py --provider elevenlabs --list-voices
```

**Cloud providers using explicit voice IDs/names**:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/notes_to_audio.py --provider minimax --list-voices
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/notes_to_audio.py --provider qwen --list-voices
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/notes_to_audio.py --provider cosyvoice --list-voices
```

The output is a flat list of all available voices for the selected provider. From this list, the AI picks **3–6 candidates** to recommend, applying these rules:

- **Cover both genders** when both exist for the locale.
- **For edge**: prefer `COMMON_VOICES`-listed voices (curated set inside `notes_to_audio.py`) when the locale has them — they are battle-tested.
- **For ElevenLabs**: prefer voices already present in the user's account; if the user provides a specific `voice_id`, do not override it.
- **For MiniMax / Qwen / CosyVoice**: if the user provides a cloned `voice_id`, use it directly. Do not attempt voice cloning inside this narration stage.
- **For CosyVoice subtitles**: use a cloned voice from a supported v3.5/v3/v2 model or a system voice marked timestamp-supported. Model and voice families must match. Use `--cosyvoice-audio-only` only when the user accepts no page-local SRT.
- **Match the deck's tone** — pick the strongest recommendation based on style:
  - Consultant / data-driven / 财报 → 稳重男声（如 `zh-CN-YunjianNeural`）or 清晰女声（如 `zh-CN-XiaoxiaoNeural`）
  - General / 教学 / 产品介绍 → 明亮女声 / 年轻男声（如 `zh-CN-XiaoyiNeural` / `zh-CN-YunxiNeural`）
  - 发布会 / 播报 → 播报感男声（如 `zh-CN-YunyangNeural`）
  - English consultant deck → `en-US-GuyNeural` (steady) or `en-US-JennyNeural` (clear)
  - Japanese / Korean → pick from `ja-JP-*` / `ko-KR-*` neural voices, mark gender + tone

For each candidate, write a **one-line Chinese description** covering: 性别 · 调性 · 适用场景。For cloud providers, include the voice name/ID exactly as it must be passed to `--voice-id`.

---

## Step 3: Resolve generation settings

**Quick exception**: do not pause. Apply explicit user values, then resolve
unspecified provider, voice, rate, and embed choices from the recommended-value
rules below. Keep video off unless the caller selected direct video; then embed
the narrated PPTX and continue to native video only when
`powerpoint_video.py --check` succeeds. If final resolved motion contains sound
cues, continue automatically through the post-export mix without another
question. An explicit slideshow-capture request instead stops at the
capture-ready narrated PPTX until the user supplies the recorded MP4; it never
silently switches to native export. Require a timestamp-capable provider only
when narration-cue sync or subtitle delivery needs page-local SRT; on the
native-export branch, audio-only narration can still calibrate the sound mix
from its complete per-page tracks.

**Default / Enhance Native — one-shot interaction (mandatory)**:

For Default or Enhance Native, send one message that resolves all five configuration decisions and recommends each value. Before offering automatic video export, run `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/powerpoint_video.py --check`; do not present an unavailable local capability as executable. Do NOT split into multiple rounds.
An explicit slideshow-capture choice does not run this availability check; it
uses the manual Windows playback handoff below.

**Cloned-voice fast path**: if the user mentioned a cloned voice / 克隆音色 / 复刻音色 / "my own voice" along with a `voice_id`, skip the voice-recommendation list — set the named provider (`elevenlabs` / `minimax` / `qwen` / `cosyvoice`) and pin that `voice_id`. Quick applies its exception above; Default and Enhance Native confirm only rate + embed + video.

**Message template** (Chinese; translate to user's chat language if different). “Embed” means caller-specific integration: SVG re-export for Generate PPTX, or native OOXML application for Enhance Native PPTX.

> 检测到 notes 主语言为 **<语言>**（locale: `<locale>`）。基于 deck 调性（<风格>），我推荐以下配置：
>
> **生成模式**：⭐ 推荐 `<edge|elevenlabs|minimax|qwen|cosyvoice>`（理由：<一句话，如"无需配置，稳定生成"或"用户要求高质量云端音色">）。
>
> **音色**：
> - **[1] <ShortName>** — <性别·调性·适用场景> ⭐ **推荐**
> - [2] <ShortName> — <性别·调性·适用场景>
> - [3] <ShortName> — <性别·调性·适用场景>
> - [4] <ShortName> — <性别·调性·适用场景>
> - [5] <ShortName> — <性别·调性·适用场景>
> - 也可直接输入清单中的其他 ShortName。
>
> **语速/风格参数**：⭐ 推荐 `<rate or provider defaults>`（理由：<一句话，如"页均 2–3 句，正常语速听感最稳"或"ElevenLabs 默认 voice settings 保留音色原始表现最稳">）。

> **生成完是否重新导出嵌入音频的 PPTX**：⭐ 推荐 **是**（一次到位，自动按音频时长设页面停留）。
>
> **带音频 PPTX 完成后是否继续导出视频**：⭐ 推荐 **原生编码**（本机 Windows PowerPoint 2016+ 可用时）。需要录下实际放映声音时可选 **实时放映录制**。
>
> 直接回"好"用全部推荐值，或告诉我想改的部分（如"音色 2，语速 -5%"或"用 MiniMax 的 voice_id xxx"）。

**Recommended-value rules**:
- 生成模式：默认 `edge`；用户指定 cloud provider / voice ID 时按其选择。需要逐页 SRT、字幕动画或视频字幕时不推荐 Qwen；用户坚持时，说明仅交付音频并跳过 SRT 步骤。
- 音色：从 Step 2 候选里挑最贴合 deck 调性的那一个。
- 语速：edge 默认 `+0%`；notes 字数密集（页均 >4 句长句）建议 `-5%`；notes 简短紧凑建议 `+5%`；超出此范围需说明理由。Cloud providers 默认用 provider defaults，除非用户明确要调速或改风格。
- 嵌入：默认推荐"是"；除非用户已有定制 PPTX 不希望覆盖。
- 视频：`powerpoint_video.py --check` 成功时默认推荐"原生编码"；只有用户明确选择时才使用"实时放映录制"。自动化不可用时交付带音频 PPTX；不得静默改用录屏或第三方渲染器。

## Step 4: Execute (no further interaction)

**Blocking notes preflight**: `notes_to_audio.py` resolves the complete notes
roster from `svg_output/*.svg` on Generate projects or
`analysis/slide_index.json` on Native Enhance projects. Before any TTS request,
every expected note must exist, be readable, and contain spoken text. Exit code
`2` returns the caller to its notes-generation step; never continue with partial
audio generation.

Run sequentially — do NOT bundle:

```bash
# 1A. Generate audio with edge (default)

# 2A. Only when narration-cue sync is selected and page SRT + animations.json
#     exist, author or refresh narration_timing.json
#     by matching SVG group semantics to SRT topics, then derive the narrated

# 2E. Only when final resolved motion has sound cues and direct MP4 delivery is
#     selected, derive the exact embedded sounds from the final narrated PPTX,
#     calibrate cue times against raw video narration, and publish the verified
#     SFX stem, mixed MP4, and report. Defaults are about 35% for transitions,

#     slideshow-capture handoff returned an MP4, otherwise the raw video.
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/video_subtitles.py <project_path> \
  --video <final_delivery_video.mp4> --language <language> --force
```

**Explicit slideshow capture**: desktop Windows PowerPoint plays the final
narrated PPTX full-screen from the beginning with automatic, click-free timing;
capture only the deck frame and one application/system-audio source, with mic,
UI, pointer, and notifications absent. Trim short head/tail handles. Human-check
streams, narration, every cue once, complete motion, and no dropped frames. The
capture has no machine cue receipt and must never enter `video_sound_mix.py`.
If the host cannot capture, report only the capture-ready PPTX handoff. Align
page SRT against an accepted capture and append one compact `workflow_log.py`
note.

**Default — bounded Edge concurrency (may override)**: Generate up to three
slide-level audio/SRT pairs concurrently. Use `--concurrency <N>` to tune the
Edge path or `--concurrency 1` for serial troubleshooting. Cloud providers
remain serial.

If `notes_to_audio.py` errors with a missing dependency or missing provider API key, fix the prerequisite and re-run — do NOT swallow the error.

The edge command writes each MP3 and its internal page SRT from the same `edge-tts` stream. SRT cues use the service's `WordBoundary` timing: sentence-ending punctuation always closes a cue; text over the default 20-visible-character limit first splits at commas, semicolons, or colons, then at the nearest word boundary. Override the limit with `--subtitle-max-chars`. Adjacent timing overlap up to 100 ms is tolerated by moving the later cue start to the previous cue end; larger overlap fails instead of silently distorting timing. Each SRT uses a page-local timeline whose origin is `00:00:00,000`, including any leading silence before the first cue.

MiniMax reads word timing from its synchronous subtitle file. ElevenLabs uses `/with-timestamps` and original-text character alignment. CosyVoice enables HTTP streaming plus `word_timestamp_enabled`, then uses the final audio URL and word timing from that synthesis; unsupported model/voice pairs fail without replacing the prior pair unless `--cosyvoice-audio-only` was explicit. Qwen exposes no timing, so it remains audio-only and this stage never estimates SRT timing.

Provider-timed paths share punctuation-first, `--subtitle-max-chars`-bounded regrouping, exact-text validation, and rollback-safe pair publication. See [`docs/audio-narration.md`](../../../../docs/audio-narration.md) for current model and audio-parameter recommendations.

Before generation starts, `notes_to_audio.py` removes stale `audio/manifest.json` and `audio/total.srt`; an incomplete run therefore cannot claim the previous set's provenance or merged timeline. A successful audio-only provider run also removes same-stem stale SRT files. The new manifest is published atomically only after the complete page roster succeeds.

**Mandatory when narration-cue sync is selected — semantic animation context**: Before writing or refreshing `<project_path>/narration_timing.json`, determine whether the active context already contains the current top-level SVG group IDs and visible group-content semantics for every affected page. Reuse that context without rereading SVG when it is complete and still matches the current `svg_output/`. If any page is missing, stale, or represented only by group IDs/order without content meaning, read only that page's SVG as a read-only source and extract the missing group semantics. Always combine those semantics with the page SRT topics/timestamps and `animations.json`; group order alone is not a semantic narration mapping.

> Narration-cue sync with `animations.json` requires `narration_timing.json`.
> Narration-independent custom motion instead passes `--animation-config animations.json`
> and makes no object-sync claim. Explicit `--no-animations`
> bypasses both. Without a timing sidecar, `narration_sync.py animations` maps
> groups **positionally** (group N → cue N) and warns when later objects may
> reveal during an earlier topic. Treat that warning as required repair: author
> the semantic plan and re-derive.

**Narration animation ownership**: When narration-cue sync is selected, `animations.json` remains read-only. The audio stage deep-copies it to `narration_animations.json`, preserves transitions, effects, durations, order, and explicit `effect: none`, then changes only the derived trigger/delay values needed for click-free narration playback. The authored `narration_timing.json` maps each animated content group—not each effect row—to the SRT cue that speaks about that content. For `effects[]`, the cue anchors the group's first active row; later rows keep global order and their relative delay. The command may still read an affected SVG page to resolve structural group order when a sparse sidecar cannot identify every effective group; this structural fallback does not replace the semantic-context step and never edits SVG, notes, or `animations.json`. Unmatched groups keep their canonical relative delay.

**Title timing handoff when canonical animation exists**: preserve the title reveal decision already made by the custom-animation pass. Assign a title group to an SRT cue only when the user's request or the active motion plan explicitly chose `narration-cued`; otherwise leave its `cue` omitted in `narration_timing.json` so it keeps the canonical relative delay from `animations.json`. Do not infer `narration-cued` merely because speaker notes mention the title.

**Narrated export animation selection**:

| Sidecar state | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `narration_animations.json` exists and narration-cue sync is selected | Use it |
| Only canonical `animations.json` exists and narration-cue sync is selected | Block until narration synchronization creates the derived sidecar |
| Canonical `animations.json` exists and motion is narration-independent, whether or not a derived sidecar also exists | Pass `--animation-config animations.json`; do not claim object sync |
| Both are absent | Create no sidecar; inherit the base report's deck motion |

Generate passes the base report through `--inherit-motion-from`: inherited
`-a none` preserves explicit objects-off, while final Stage-2 `false` does not.
Only explicit all-motion-off uses `--no-animations`. Invalid reports block;
page-start lead-in, audio duration, and page-tail padding own final advance.

**Narration pacing controls**: page-front and page-tail timing are independent,
optional parameters. Unless the user supplies values, use
`narration_start_floor=0.8` seconds and `narration_padding=0.5` seconds without
adding a confirmation question. For a destination-page transition of `T`
seconds, the post-transition lead-in is
`max(0, narration_start_floor - T)`: narration never begins during the
transition, while a longer transition is not stretched. Apply the same
lead-in to embedded narration, cue-bound object animation, subtitle offsets,
and slide advance. Uncued title or decorative animation keeps its canonical
relative timing. Setting the start floor to `0` means narration begins as soon
as the transition completes; it does not bypass the transition.

When canonical custom animation is synchronized,
`<project_path>/narration_timing.json` is the explicit semantic mapping for
narrated object animation. It is fingerprinted to the ordered SRT set; `cue`
is the 1-based subtitle cue, and omitted `cue` keeps that group's canonical
relative delay. Reuse a complete current mapping when its fingerprint and SVG
group semantics remain valid; rebuild only affected pages when either input
changed.

Get the exact fingerprint value with:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/narration_sync.py fingerprint <project_path>
```

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "srt_sha256": "<sha256 of the ordered page-local SRT set>",
  "narration_start_floor": 0.8,
  "narration_padding": 0.5,
  "slides": {
    "01_title": {
      "groups": [
        { "id": "page-title", "cue": 1 },
        { "id": "supporting-visual" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`narration_sync.py subtitles` may still write `<project_path>/audio/total.srt` as a PPTX-timeline diagnostic. It is not the delivery subtitle for a finished video.

When video export was selected, `powerpoint_video.py` opens the final narrated
PPTX through local Windows PowerPoint, requests its native video encoder with
recorded timings and narrations enabled, and polls `CreateVideoStatus` until the
MP4 succeeds, fails, or times out. The interface is synchronous to its caller
even though PowerPoint performs encoding asynchronously. It preserves the
native visual-animation and narration path rather than re-rendering the deck,
but does not reliably write transition or object-animation sounds into the MP4
audio track. This is the default automated video path; an explicitly selected
slideshow capture bypasses `CreateVideo` but still uses desktop PowerPoint as
the real-time renderer and audio player.

If native video export fails, keep the narrated PPTX as a successful upstream
artifact and report the video failure separately. Do not regenerate audio or
the PPTX unless their own validation failed.

On the native-export path, when the final narrated trace and PPTX contain sound
cues, treat the PowerPoint MP4 as a raw intermediate. `video_sound_mix.py`
cross-checks that trace against the final PPTX read-back, extracts the exact
embedded sound relationships, calibrates every page against the raw video's
narration, renders a float SFX stem, and mixes it with narration at unity gain.
Transition cues default to about 35%, object cues to about 25%; `amix`
normalization and ducking remain off, and a -1 dBFS peak limiter follows the
mix. The receipt must prove a non-silent stem, preserved video-stream hash,
changed and present final audio, duration parity, non-clipping true peak, and
correlation between the added final-audio component and the stem. A valid
`animations.json` or OOXML package alone is not MP4 audio acceptance.

After the final delivery MP4 exists, `video_subtitles.py` takes the exact
narration text frozen in the page SRT set and force-aligns it against that
finished video's actual audio track with `stable-ts`. Use the mixed MP4 when
sound mixing ran, the accepted capture when slideshow recording ran, otherwise
the raw PowerPoint MP4. Long delivery cues may be split for display at this
final stage. This writes a same-stem external SRT without changing the MP4,
notes, page SRT, or animation files.

This stage keeps subtitles as external SRT files and never burns them in.
Automatic export is an optional Windows PowerPoint integration. When it is
unavailable, stop after the narrated PPTX unless explicit capture is selected;
that handoff remains incomplete until a real capture is accepted.

**Caller integration**:

| Caller | After audio generation |
|---|---|
| Generate PPTX | Derive narration-cued motion when selected; otherwise pass canonical motion, inherit base motion, or use explicit all-motion-off. Export with `--recorded-narration audio`; Quick also passes `--quick-generate --with-notes`. Native video uses conversion trace plus raw export and cue mix as required. Explicit capture returns the narrated PPTX for the handoff above, skips trace-only sound work and mixing, then aligns subtitles against the accepted capture. |
| Enhance Native PPTX | Return to [`native-enhance-pptx`](../native-enhance-pptx.md) Step 9. Native video passes its final PPTX to `powerpoint_video.py`; explicit capture uses the same handoff above and skips mixing. |

For Qwen or explicit CosyVoice audio-only mode, embed/export the audio normally
but skip `narration_timing.json`, `narration_sync.py animations`, SRT merge, and
final-video subtitle alignment. Pass canonical narration-independent custom
motion explicitly when present. On the native-export branch, a direct-MP4 sound
mix may still run because page audio, not SRT, supplies its correlation
template. Never present missing subtitle artifacts or object sync as generated.

For Generate PPTX, `--recorded-narration audio` prepares PowerPoint's recorded timings and narrations: every slide must have a matching supported audio file, every duration must be readable by `ffprobe`, and object animations must not use `--animation-trigger on-click`. Use `after-previous` or `with-previous` for narrated/video export. Narration changes the slide-advance layer only: the resolved page-transition effect remains unchanged, `-t none` remains visually transition-free, and narration advance disables click while using page-start lead-in plus audio duration plus page-tail padding. The re-export is saved as `exports/<project_name>_<timestamp>_narrated.pptx`, telling it apart from silent exports.

**Narrated SVG export**: use the default text-flow mode. It keeps authored line breaks in one editable, no-wrap text frame; narration does not require per-line text frames.

---

## Step 5: Completion report

Output one summary block listing:

- Number of audio files generated and their location (`<project_path>/audio/*`).
- For provider-timed subtitles, number of matching page-local SRT files and their location (`<project_path>/audio/*`); for Qwen or explicit CosyVoice audio-only mode, report that no page-local SRT was generated.
- Narration provider/model plus the `<project_path>/audio/manifest.json` provenance path.
- For narrated object animation, whether current SVG semantics were reused or which missing/stale pages were reread, plus semantic mapping coverage and fallback count.
- For Generate PPTX, report derived narration animation coverage/path when cue sync ran, the canonical config path for narration-independent custom motion, or inherited/all-motion-off state.
- When native video export was selected, the raw PowerPoint MP4 path/status.
  When resolved cues triggered sound mixing, also report the final mixed MP4,
  SFX stem, cue count, and `video_sound_mix.py` receipt; otherwise identify the
  raw MP4 as final.
- For slideshow capture, report the capture-ready PPTX handoff or accepted MP4
  plus system-audio and human picture/narration/all-cue status; never report a
  mix receipt.
- When page-local SRT was merged, the PPTX-timeline `audio/total.srt` path.
- When final-video subtitle alignment ran, the aligned delivery SRT path and
  whether its source was the mixed, captured, or raw final video;
  otherwise do not claim a video-aligned subtitle.
- The provider, voice, and rate/settings actually used.
- The caller-owned integration result: narrated SVG export path, enhanced native PPTX path, or “audio only”.
- For Generate PPTX when embedding was skipped, one-line hint: `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --recorded-narration audio`.
