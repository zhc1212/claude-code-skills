# Customize Animations Stage

> Optional Generate-PPTX post-processing stage for per-slide or per-object
> animation control. Run when `<project_path>/animations.json` already exists,
> when the user explicitly asks to customize slide-specific motion, object
> order, effects, timing, or reveals, or when the effective Custom Animations
> outcome in `design_spec.md §I` is enabled. Deck-wide transitions,
> auto-advance, and deck-wide per-element settings without page-specific motion
> or an existing sidecar use [`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md)
> directly and do not activate this stage. In Quick Generate, the current agent
> may activate either path from the request/deck in active context without a
> Design Spec or user interaction.

## When to Run

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Effective Custom Animations outcome in `design_spec.md §I` is enabled | Run this stage after the final SVG quality gate and any enabled speaker-note pass, before Generate Step 7; use §IX suggestions as advice |
| User asks for per-slide or per-object animation, reveal order, timing, or effect changes | Run this stage |
| `<project_path>/animations.json` already exists | Run this stage to resolve preserve/adjust/replace/suppress intent before export |
| §IX contains `Motion suggestion`, but no trigger above is active | Do not run; retain the suggestion as Strategist advice and keep normal export defaults |
| No motion request, enabled outcome, or existing sidecar; user only wants the default deck | Do not run; normal export keeps page transitions and no element builds |
| No existing sidecar; user only wants deck-wide page transitions, auto-advance, or one per-element object animation policy | Do not run; apply [`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) with exporter flags such as `-a auto` or `-a emphasis_spin` |
| Only a page-transition sound is requested, with no object-specific motion or existing sidecar | Do not run the full stage solely for sound; resolve a sparse transition sidecar through [`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) §2.2 at export time |
| An object-animation sound is requested | Run this stage because the cue must bind to a resolved animation row and real object target |
| `svg_output/*.svg` is missing | Complete the main Executor phase first |

**Decision precedence**: latest explicit instruction → final Stage-2 policy →
workflow default `false`; provenance stays in Design Spec §I, never the
lock. Final Stage-2 `false` blocks creation, not an existing sidecar. Existing
sidecars enter this stage; explicit disables follow the table without deletion.

---

## 1. Resolve Intent and Read Semantic Context

**Context read**: before editing `animations.json`, read every semantic planning file below that exists.

| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `<project_path>/design_spec.md` | Understand each slide's content intent, narrative role, and visual emphasis |
| `<project_path>/spec_lock.md` | Confirm page rhythm, layout role, chart/template constraints, and execution contract |
| `<project_path>/notes/total.md` or `<project_path>/notes/*.md` | Use speaker flow to tune reveal order, delays, and emphasis |

**Existing sidecar intent gate**:

| User intent | Action |
|---|---|
| Explicit Custom Animations disable | Preserve and validate the sidecar; return `-a none` |
| Explicit all-motion disable | Preserve and bypass the sidecar; return `--no-animations` |
| Explicit regeneration / rewrite / replacement | Rebuild the semantic grouping plan and replace `animations.json`; the previous choreography is not a constraint |
| Explicit adjustment / tuning / repair | Validate first, preserve the existing choreography where its semantic units remain valid, and migrate affected group references after any required regrouping |
| Stage activated with an existing sidecar and new §IX suggestions but no user replacement request | Validate first; preserve valid existing choreography and adjust only the affected semantic units |
| Existing sidecar with no new motion instruction | Validate and preserve it unchanged; if invalid, repair the owning sidecar/group reference before export |
| Ambiguous generation request | Default Generate asks whether to regenerate or modify; Quick Generate decides from the request, visible SVG, and existing sidecar, then continues |

Unless explicit all-motion disable bypasses it, validate an existing sidecar
before deciding to preserve, modify, or suppress object motion:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py validate <project_path>
```

**Hard rule**: semantic files determine both animation intent and animation
unit boundaries. The current `svg_output/*.svg` supplies visible content and
implementation structure, but its existing `<g>` hierarchy is not accepted as
the animation plan merely because it already exists.

**Optional-context fallback**: these semantic files inform this supporting stage but are not its gate artifacts. If any are absent, state what is missing and proceed with every remaining file plus visible SVG content. If all three context inputs are absent, use only explicit user instructions, visible SVG content, and the resolution rules in [`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md); do not infer detailed choreography beyond what the page itself expresses.

**Decision ownership — understand, then design**: A §IX `Motion suggestion`
expresses the Strategist's communication job and semantic relationship; it
neither activates this stage nor locks implementation. Once active, understand
that intent, then develop the motion brief from the final SVG's semantic units,
visible states, composition, and speaker flow. Do not mechanically map it to
groups, effects, order, or timing. Executor may preserve, adapt, simplify,
decline, or choose `none`; an unchanged realization is valid and requires no
novelty. Explicit user motion requirements bind. Never change page
content merely to justify animation.

**Hard rule — existing visible-layer boundary**: This stage may regroup existing content only under §2 visual equivalence; it MUST NOT create or modify a crop, comparison layer, scrim, lens, hotspot, annotation, or other visible image state to satisfy motion intent. When a required state is missing and ordinary Slide-local authoring can supply it, return to Generate Step 6, rerun the final SVG gate and regenerate notes only when speaker notes are enabled, then resume here. If a structural boundary prevents that repair, simplify a non-binding suggestion to legal existing units, a page transition, or `none`; an explicit requirement follows failure recovery instead of changing structure.

**No-op is complete**: Evaluate suggestions before regrouping SVG content. If
no `animations.json` exists, every page should retain the normal `fade`
transition and no object builds, and no explicit user requirement remains
unmet, change no SVG, create no sidecar, and return to Generate Step 7. Never
author motion merely to expose a capability.

---

## 2. Rebuild Semantic Motion Units When Needed, Then List IDs

**Mandatory when object-targeted motion is in scope — content-first grouping
audit**: inspect each affected slide's visible content against its communication
job and speaker flow before treating any top-level `<g>` as an animation
anchor. The affected set is the page named by an adopted suggestion or explicit
object-motion request, plus both endpoints of each deterministic Morph pair.
Untouched pages need no animation audit. Existing groups are implementation
evidence only. Keep a current group unchanged only after confirming that it
already represents exactly one audience-facing motion unit or one continuing
Morph object. A page-transition-only plan without explicit Morph pairs skips
regrouping and group listing.

| Content condition | Required grouping action |
|---|---|
| One current group contains several independently narrated rows, cards, steps, claims, or stages | Split it into descriptive direct-root sibling groups, one per motion unit |
| One motion unit is scattered across groups or root primitives | Merge or wrap its background, icon, label, value, and supporting text into one direct-root group |
| A connector or arrow explains entry into a node or stage | Keep it with the relationship or target unit that makes the connection intelligible |
| A hero visual, overview graphic, takeaway, or warning has its own communication role | Give it its own semantic group |
| The same semantic object continues across adjacent Morph pages | Isolate each endpoint as one direct-root group and keep both endpoints as compatible object kinds |
| Several atoms express one inseparable idea | Keep them together; do not animate the atoms separately |
| Page chrome, structural layers, or static framing | Preserve their structure and exclude them from ordinary animation targets |

**Hard rule — visual equivalence**: regrouping changes object boundaries only.
Preserve all visible content, paint order, coordinates, transforms, inherited
paint, opacity, clipping, filters, references, and native metadata. Keep
rendering-bearing implementation wrappers nested inside the new semantic group
when flattening or distributing their attributes could change appearance.

**Hard rule — structural boundary**: never split or merge across
`data-pptx-layer`, `data-pptx-placeholder`, native chart/table carrier, native
preset, or imported logical-object boundaries. Structural/static objects remain
non-animatable. Ordinary Slide-local content groups follow
[`shared-standards-core.md`](../../references/shared-standards-core.md) §4.3:
every visible direct-root group has a descriptive unique `id` and positive
root-coordinate `data-pptx-bounds`; nested implementation groups carry no
bounds.

**Forbidden — group-list-first choreography**:

- Choosing effects or order from the pre-existing `list-groups` output before the content-first audit
- Keeping a coarse wrapper only because it already has an `id`
- Splitting one semantic idea into individual shapes or text lines to increase animation count
- Merging unrelated ideas to reduce animation count
- Adding animation-specific `data-*` attributes to SVG

There is no target group count. Granularity follows the page's actual claims,
comparisons, sequence, causality, and narration beats.

After any regrouping, rerun the final SVG quality gate because `svg_output/`
changed. Use the owning route's checker form; Quick Generate must add its
lockless profile flag:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path> --stage final --json
# Quick Generate: insert --quick-generate before --stage.
```

Then list the **post-regroup** anchors:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py list-groups <project_path>
```

Output is one line per slide: `<slide_basename>: id1, id2, id3`. Default chrome
groups (`bg` / `*-header` / `*-footer` / `*-decor` / `nav` / `watermark` /
`logo` / `pagenumber`) are excluded. This post-regroup list is the source of
truth when planning §3 and editing §4; never invent a slide or group key.

An explicit sidecar entry may override only the marker-free legacy id-name
heuristic. A group carrying `data-pptx-layer` or an explicit static
role/placeholder marker can never animate, even when it is named explicitly.

If `animations.json` does not exist and a starting file is useful, scaffold
only after semantic regrouping:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py scaffold <project_path>
```

The scaffold is neutral: its default object effect is `none`, and listed groups
may remain empty `{}` placeholders until adopted. Creating it does not select
generic entrance animation. Do not read the full scaffold unless it is needed
as an editing starting point.

---

## 3. Plan Slide and Object Motion

**Mandatory**: plan the requested motion layers for each affected slide before
editing `animations.json`. A local object-animation request does not require a
deck-wide transition review.

| Layer | Config path | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Page transition | `defaults.transition` or `slides.<slide>.transition` | Control how one slide enters from the previous slide |
| Deterministic Morph pair | `slides.<destination>.morph` | Bind one real source group to one real destination group when semantic identity continues across adjacent slides |
| Page animation defaults | `defaults.animation` or `slides.<slide>.animation` | Control the default object-animation behavior for animated groups on a slide |
| Object lifecycle | `slides.<slide>.groups.<group_id>` | Assign one legacy effect row or an ordered `effects[]` sequence to a real SVG motion unit |

**Per-affected-page motion brief**: classify the communication job—including
none—and each unit's lifecycle. Choose only the required transition, effect,
order, timing, and one dominant Start rhythm; mix modes or add emphasis and
exit only for a distinct job with a restrained, fitting effect. Read
`design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`, speaker notes, and SVG group ids for role,
rhythm, order, and target validity.

**Mandatory — select from meaning, not catalog coverage**: run the
page-relationship and lifecycle selection playbooks in
[`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) §3 and §4 before choosing any
specific effect. Their candidates are recall aids, not coverage targets; this
stage binds the selected duties to real targets.

**Title motion decision**: when a title participates, classify its lifecycle,
then choose immediate, delayed, synchronized, post-hero, or narration-cued
timing from slide intent. Use the sidecar override for a marker-free legacy
chrome-like id; repair an incorrect explicit structural/static marker before
animating it.

**Default — inherit unaffected motion layers (may override when the page's
communication job requires it)**: a custom object-animation pass may leave the
page transition and every untouched page on exporter or sidecar defaults. Add a
slide-specific `transition` only when the affected page needs one; never add
variation for coverage.

**Timing guidance**: use shorter motion for dense/repeated scan content and
longer motion for conceptual pivots, hero diagrams, section boundaries, and
final takeaways. Uniform timing is valid when it fits the requested style.

**Reference — not a constraint: motion judgment.** Decide the communication
job, lifecycle, tone, audience order, and whether direction carries meaning
before using geometry. If motion adds no clarity or intended feeling, classify
the unit `static`; use `none`, `entrance_appear`, or `entrance_fade` only when
that result matches the lifecycle. Layout direction alone does not require
special motion; variation follows a real content/tone change, never a quota.

### 3.1 Supported Page Transitions

Use one of the 48 canonical native effects from the complete shared registry in
[`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) §3. It covers all current
PowerPoint Subtle, Exciting, and Dynamic Content gallery effects. The eight old
names are readable only as compatibility inputs; do not write them in new
plans or sidecars. They normalize to a canonical effect plus native
`effect_options` before writing. `none` removes the visual page transition
while allowing timed advance to remain.

**Transition fields**:

| Field | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `effect` | One supported page transition effect; `none` removes only the visual effect |
| `effect_options` | Optional object containing only the selected native effect's PowerPoint Effect Options; requires an explicit `effect` |
| `duration` | Finite transition duration in seconds; must be greater than zero |
| `auto_advance` | Optional finite non-negative seconds before automatic slide advance; click remains enabled, and this field is valid with `effect: none` |
| `sound` | Optional project-relative `.wav` cue; select and sync it only after the transition solution is resolved |

Run
`python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/pptx_animations.py --describe-transition <effect>`
before authoring Effect Options. Never infer that one effect accepts another
effect's direction, shape, pattern, or boolean fields.

For a cross-slide object continuation that must not depend on PowerPoint's
automatic matching, put one explicit `morph` block on the destination slide.
Its `from` slide must be the immediately preceding exported SVG; each stable
pair key binds one source direct-root group id to one destination direct-root
group id. The exporter supplies PowerPoint's `!!` prefix. Use Morph by object;
word/character Morph does not accept this object-pair contract.

### 3.2 Supported In-Slide Animations

Use the 203 canonical PowerPoint-native keys: 53 `entrance_*`, 33
`emphasis_*`, 64 `path_*`, and 53 `exit_*`. Run
`python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/pptx_animations.py --list` for the exact
categorized names. Each key preserves PowerPoint's complete authored behavior
tree. Media-only commands remain in the audio/video workflows.

| Choice | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `entrance_*` / `emphasis_*` / `path_*` / `exit_*` | Select one explicit canonical PowerPoint object effect |
| `auto` | Generic `enter` only: map content roles to canonical entrances; image-like ids use a richer canonical pool |
| `mixed` | Generic `enter` only: cycle 16 canonical entrance presets by group order |
| `random` | Generic `enter` only: select deterministically from the same canonical entrance pool |
| `none` | Exclude the object or slide from in-slide animation |

The 29 old short names remain readable only as compatibility inputs; do not use
them in new plans or sidecars. All Fly direction names normalize to
`entrance_fly`, all Wipe direction names normalize to `entrance_wipe`, and the
other old names normalize to their matching `entrance_*` preset. `cut`
normalizes to `entrance_appear`. Compatibility Fly/Wipe aliases preserve their
direction as `effect_options.direction`; legacy `wheel` preserves its historical
four-spoke amount.

`auto`, `mixed`, and `random` never choose emphasis, motion-path, or exit
effects implicitly. Use them only after classifying a unit as a generic
`enter`; select an explicit canonical key for every adopted `emphasize`,
`move`, or `exit` duty.

**Hard rule — explicit semantic choreography**: When an adopted plan depends
on a specific lifecycle, relationship, or order, target its real groups with
explicit canonical effects and order; do not delegate those material decisions
to `auto`, `mixed`, or `random`. Those modes remain valid only when generic
entrance treatment is sufficient.

**Start modes**:

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `after-previous` | Default click-free cascade |
| `with-previous` | One coordinated beat together |
| `on-click` | Controlled semantic reveal |

### 3.3 Optional Sound Pass

Run this pass only after the visual transition, object lifecycle, effect,
order, and timing decisions above are complete. Sound selection is
post-processing state: do not recover it from or write it back to
`design_spec.md` / `spec_lock.md`, and do not treat it as a pre-SVG resource.

| Need | Action |
|---|---|
| No resolved cue needs sound | Omit every `sound` field; do not create `<project_path>/sounds/` |
| A bundled cue fits one resolved transition or animation row | Discover with `sound_sync.py list [--query <term>]`, then sync only the chosen namespaced id(s) into the project |
| The project already contains user-provided audio | Use its project-relative path when its format is valid; no library sync is required |

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/sound_sync.py list --query <term>
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/sound_sync.py \
  <project_path> <namespace>/<sound_id> [<namespace>/<sound_id> ...]
```

Use the corresponding `sounds/<namespace>/<file>.wav` path in
`transition.sound`, `animation.sound`, or the selected group/effect row. Never
reference `skills/ppt-master/templates/sounds/` from `animations.json`. The
global library is a selection source, not an exporter fallback.

This pass owns only native PPTX cue selection and configuration. When direct
narrated MP4 delivery is active, leave gain, limiting, and video mixing to
[`generate-audio`](./generate-audio.md) after the final narrated export; do not
write those post-production values into `animations.json`.

---

## 4. Edit `animations.json`

**Hard rule — sparse overrides reference real targets**: write only affected
slides and only fields that differ from exporter or sidecar defaults. An
unlisted SVG inherits the resolved deck-wide settings; a listed slide may
contain only `transition`, `animation`, `groups`, or `morph` fields that it
actually overrides. `defaults` is optional and belongs only to intentional
deck-wide settings. Group-level overrides remain opt-in. Chrome groups stay out
(the exporter pins them to `none` by default). Name a legacy chrome-like id only
when the user explicitly wants that content animated and the SVG has no
explicit structural layer, role, or placeholder marker.

**Forbidden**:

- Referencing a slide that does not exist in `svg_output/`
- Referencing a missing, ambiguous, or structural group
- Enumerating every content group in a slide just to restate the slide-level default effect
- Listing a group with `data-pptx-layer` or an explicit static role/placeholder marker
- Listing a legacy chrome-like id without an explicit, reviewed intent to override the name heuristic

| Field | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `transition.effect` | Slide-specific page transition effect |
| `transition.effect_options` | Effect-specific native PowerPoint options; requires an explicit slide-specific `transition.effect` |
| `transition.duration` | Slide-specific page transition duration |
| `transition.sound` | Optional project-relative `.wav` cue copied during §3.3; valid with `effect: none`; set a slide override to `null` to clear an inherited default sound |
| `morph.from` | Immediately preceding SVG stem for an explicit deterministic Morph transition |
| `morph.pairs.<key>.from` / `.to` | Unique source/destination direct-root group ids that receive the shared PowerPoint name `!!<key>` |
| `animation.effect` | Slide-specific default object animation effect |
| `animation.duration` | Slide-specific default object schedule duration |
| `animation.stagger` | Slide-specific delay between object animation rows |
| `animation.trigger` | Slide-specific start mode |
| `groups.<id>.effects` | Non-empty ordered array for a multi-duty lifecycle; every row explicitly names `effect`, and `effects` cannot coexist with legacy single-effect fields in the same group block |
| `groups.<id>.effect` | Backward-compatible single-row form: one canonical native effect, `auto`, `mixed`, `random`, or `none`; old names are read-only compatibility inputs |
| `effects[].trigger` / legacy `trigger` | Row-specific Start mode; omitted values inherit `animation.trigger` |
| `order` | Page-wide order for ordinary rows; ties retain SVG group order and then `effects[]` index. `trigger_shape` rows keep relative order in separate interactive sequences; SVG layer order never changes |
| `delay` | Row-specific seconds added to the resolved Start or shape trigger |
| `duration` | Per-row schedule duration in seconds; scalable native behavior trees keep their internal timing ratios, while `entrance_appear` and instantaneous native presets retain their PowerPoint-authored duration and use this value for subsequent `after-previous` spacing |
| `effect_options` | Effect-specific PowerPoint parameters; requires an explicit canonical `effect` in the same legacy block or `effects[]` row |
| `trigger_shape` | Different top-level group id for native **On Click of**; row-only and not inherited. It implies `on-click`; an explicit row `trigger` may accompany it only when also `on-click` |
| `repeat_count` / `repeat_duration` | Repeat count or total repeat span; mutually exclusive |
| `auto_reverse`, `rewind` | Reverse each cycle and/or restore the pre-animation state |
| `accelerate`, `decelerate`, `bounce_end` | `0..1` timing ratios; acceleration plus deceleration must not exceed `1`; bounce requires an interpolated effect and cannot combine with deceleration |
| `restart` | `always`, `when-not-active`, or `never` |
| `after_effect` | `none`, `dim` with `color`, `hide`, or `hide-on-next-click` |
| `sound` | Object-animation cue. Existing low-level inputs accept project-relative or absolute `.m4a`, `.mp3`, or `.wav`; bundled selections use the synced project-relative `.wav` path from §3.3 |

**Hard rule — one group representation**: A populated
`groups.<id>` object uses either the backward-compatible single-effect fields
or `effects[]`, never both. `effects[]` must contain at least one object, and
every row explicitly names `effect`. An untouched scaffold `{}` is a neutral
placeholder. Omitted row duration, Start, timing/completion controls, and sound
inherit the resolved slide animation values exactly as the legacy form does.

`effect_options` may contain `direction`, `amount`, `color`, `font_name`,
`relative`, or `size`, but validation permits only fields supported by the
selected effect. Before writing a parameterized effect, run
`python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/pptx_animations.py --describe
<canonical_effect>` and use the returned values exactly. `duration` owns
PowerPoint Speed; `accelerate`/`decelerate` own smooth start/end, so do not
invent duplicate fields. Change Font's `font_name` is one concrete
target-installed PowerPoint face, never a CSS font stack.

Use the coherent multi-category `effects[]` example in
[`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) §2. Its static frame stays
unlisted while one real unit runs enter → move → emphasize → exit. Keep the
legacy object for one-row overrides; never convert old sidecars mechanically.

Use the complete two-slide deterministic Morph example in
[`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) §2.1; do not copy the source
group into the destination slide's `groups` block merely to establish identity.

**Forbidden — SVG pollution**: do not add `data-*` animation attributes to SVG files. Animation customization belongs in `animations.json`.

---

## 5. Validate and Return to Generate Export

When `animations.json` was newly created or changed after the §1 validation,
run:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/animation_config.py validate <project_path>
```

After validation succeeds, return to the owning export path:

- Default Generate → [`generate-pptx.md`](../generate-pptx.md) Step 7.1, which
  owns note splitting, `finalize_svg.py`, native export, and the published
  postflight receipt.
- Quick Generate → [`quick-generate.md`](../profiles/quick-generate.md) §4,
  which skips finalization and exports with `--quick-generate`.

Both exporters read `<project_path>/animations.json` automatically. If §2
changed `svg_output/`, complete the owning route's required final SVG quality
rerun before returning. Do not finalize or export independently from this
stage.

**Validation**: The later native export must reflect the per-slide and
per-object overrides. `--animation none` still disables all per-element
animation and overrides `animations.json`. Unknown animation
effects/modes/triggers; unsupported effect options; incompatible, boolean,
non-finite, or out-of-range timing parameters; non-positive durations; negative
delay/stagger; invalid order; missing slides/groups; and structural-layer
targets fail validation. Transition validation remains strict. None of these
failures substitutes a fallback effect or silently drops a requested target.
Deterministic Morph also rejects non-adjacent source slides, missing or
ambiguous direct-root groups, conflicting or undeclared shared keys, non-object
Morph, and any target that does not remain one compatible Slide-local object
after structure processing.

**Validation boundary**: a passing sidecar, timing-tree read-back, and sound
relationship check proves the PPTX configuration only. It does not prove the
PowerPoint-exported MP4 audio track contains those cues.

Generate Step 7 export reads back row order, including repeated rows targeting
one shape, trigger, target, resolved effect, duration, offset, timing placement,
IDs, and shape references. Narration
preserves these rows. Direct-PPTX routes fingerprint and preserve source object
animation; they never author it. See
[`pptx-animations.md`](../../scripts/docs/pptx-animations.md).

### 5.1 Optional Video Motion Handoff

When a downstream video renderer will enhance the deck, have Generate Step 7.3
append `--conversion-trace`. After that final export succeeds, derive the motion
plan from its resolved trace:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/video_motion_plan.py \
  <project_path>/validation/<output_stem>.trace.json \
  -o <project_path>/validation/video_motion_plan.json \
  --style adaptive \
  --force
```

For narrated output, use the final `--recorded-narration` trace. When resolved
sound cues exist and the native-export mix branch is selected, that same final
trace and the final narrated PPTX feed `video_sound_mix.py`; never infer cue
timing from the raw sidecar or filenames. An explicit slideshow capture already
records PowerPoint's native cue playback and does not use the trace for sound
mixing. The video plan locks identity, effect, direction, order, bounds, and
timing; it may refine renderer parameters but cannot replace the source effect.
See
[`video-motion-plan.md`](../../scripts/docs/video-motion-plan.md).
