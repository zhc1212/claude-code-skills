# Stage 3 — First Round

Stage 3 assembles your per-issue response drafts from Stage 2 into a single, formatted document ready to paste directly into your conference submission platform. This stage is about formatting, structure, and length management — the technical content was finalized in Stage 2.

## In the Pipeline

```
... → Stage 2: Reply → Stage 3: First Round → Stage 4: Multi Rounds (optional) → Stage 5: Final Remarks
```

Stage 3 takes the Refined Drafts from Stage 2 and composes them into a coherent, per-reviewer rebuttal document. The output is copy-ready text formatted to meet conference presentation conventions.

## Before You Begin

- [ ] Stage 2 is complete — every atomic issue has a non-empty, reviewed Refined Draft.
- [ ] You know the word or character limit for your conference's rebuttal field (OpenReview typically allows up to ~6000 characters per reviewer response field).
- [ ] You have decided on a theme color for your rebuttal (optional, but choosing before formatting is easier).

> **Note:** Stage 3 does not modify the substance of your responses. If you realize a response needs a factual correction at this stage, go back to Stage 2 and edit the Refined Draft there, then return.

## Interface Overview

**Per-issue view (default)**
The default view shows one tab per atomic issue (Response 1, Response 2, …). Each tab displays the formatted response block for that issue, rendered with the chosen style template. This is where you apply inline formatting and review individual responses.

**"All" tab**
Switches the view to the full assembled rebuttal for the current reviewer. This includes:
- An **opening paragraph** addressed to the reviewer, thanking them for specific strengths they acknowledged.
- All response blocks in numbered sequence.
- A **closing paragraph** wrapping up the rebuttal.
- A **Total words** badge in the header. In the current app, this badge is character-based even though the label still says "Total words".

**Formatting toolbar**
Available in both per-issue and All views. Tools include: **Bold**, *Italic*, underline, text color, heading levels, and **Writing Anti-AI** on selected text. Select text in the response area and use the available controls to apply formatting or de-formulaic rewriting.

**"Style" button**
Opens the First Round Style modal, where you can choose a theme color for the response labels (the `Response N:` and `Weakness-N:` identifiers). Options include 7 preset colors or a custom hex code. Colored labels help reviewers navigate a long rebuttal with multiple responses.

**"To break down" button**
Appears when the assembled text is close to or exceeds your platform's limit. Opens a modal where you enter the maximum character count per part (e.g., `4000`). The app splits the full "All" text into chunks at natural paragraph boundaries and displays each chunk in a result modal for copying.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Review each per-issue response tab.**
   Click through the Response tabs (Response 1, Response 2, …) and read each formatted block. Check:
   - Tone: professional, direct, and not defensive.
   - Accuracy: quoted issue matches the reviewer's original text.
   - Completeness: your response directly addresses the concern.

2. **Apply inline formatting where it adds clarity.**
   Select text and use the toolbar to:
   - **Bold** key findings or conclusions that the reviewer should not miss.
   - Use *italic* sparingly, for emphasis only.
   - Apply heading levels if a single response has multiple distinct sub-sections.

   > **Tip:** Use formatting to highlight your main answer, not to decorate. If everything is bold, nothing stands out.

3. **Click "Style" to choose a theme color.**
   Open the Style modal and pick a theme color. The color will be applied to the structured labels (`Response 1:`, `Weakness-1:`, etc.) throughout the document, making the rebuttal visually scannable. Avoid bright yellows (low contrast on white) or very dark colors (hard to distinguish from body text).

4. **Switch to the "All" tab.**
   Review the full assembled rebuttal from start to finish as a complete document. Pay attention to:
   - The **opening paragraph**: it contains placeholder slots for the reviewer's acknowledged strengths (e.g., "Thank you for acknowledging the A, B, and C of our method…"). Replace `A`, `B`, and `C` with the actual strengths the reviewer mentioned in their review.
   - Transitions between adjacent response blocks — do they flow naturally together, or do they feel abrupt?
   - The **closing paragraph**: standard template; review and adjust if your situation warrants a different closing note.

5. **Check the "Total words" badge.**
   In the current app this is effectively a character counter. If it approaches your platform's limit, you have two options:
   - **Manually trim:** Go back to Stage 2 and shorten specific Refined Drafts. This gives you control over where content is cut.
   - **Use "To break down":** Enter your platform's character limit per post in the modal. The app splits the content into chunks and presents each chunk for copying. Post each chunk separately in the rebuttal field with a "Part 1 of N / Part 2 of N" header so the reviewer can follow the sequence.

6. **Copy the final text to your submission platform.**
   - If the rebuttal fits in one block: switch to "All", select all, and copy.
   - If split into parts: open "To break down", copy each chunk from the result modal, and paste each as a separate entry on the platform.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Replace the opening paragraph placeholders before copying.** The default opening template has `A`, `B`, and `C` as placeholders for the reviewer's acknowledged strengths. If you paste without replacing these, the reviewer will see literal "A, B, and C" in your opening sentence.
- **Avoid splitting mid-argument.** If "To break down" produces a split that cuts in the middle of a related argument, adjust the character limit slightly or trim one response to keep the split at a natural boundary between issues.
- **Check theme colors in context.** The same color can look very different in OpenReview's white background vs. a dark-mode browser. Preview a few response labels before committing to a color.
- **Use Writing Anti-AI surgically.** If one paragraph sounds stiff, select only that span and rewrite it, rather than restyling the whole response.
- **Use the per-issue tabs for focused review, the All tab for final review.** Doing one pass in per-issue view and one pass in All view catches different categories of issues.

## What to Expect

A complete Stage 3 for each reviewer produces:

- A clean, formatted document with an opening paragraph, numbered response blocks, and a closing paragraph.
- All `A`, `B`, `C` opening paragraph placeholders replaced with actual reviewer-acknowledged strengths.
- Overall length within the platform's limit (or split into clearly labeled parts if needed).
- Colored, scannable response labels if a theme color was applied.

## Next Steps

If reviewers respond with follow-up questions during the discussion period, proceed to **[Stage 4 — Multi Rounds](./stage4-multi-rounds.md)**.

If the discussion period ends without follow-ups, or after resolving all follow-ups, proceed to **[Stage 5 — Final Remarks](./stage5-final-remarks.md)** to write the Final Remarks for Area Chairs.
