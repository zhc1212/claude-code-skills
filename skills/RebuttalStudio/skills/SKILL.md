# RebuttalStudio Multi-Stage Skill

Follow this dispatcher structure:

1. Identify stage first (`stage1`, `stage2`, `stage4`, or `stage5`).
2. For `stage1` and `stage2`, apply the stage template first, then select conference-specific extension.
3. Execute the conference skill instructions directly.

## Available stage workflows

- `stage1/template/SKILL.md`: Shared Stage 1 breakdown template. Apply before conference overrides.
- `stage1/iclr/SKILL.md`: Convert raw reviewer feedback into a structured breakdown for rebuttal drafting.
- `stage1/icml/SKILL.md`: Convert raw reviewer feedback into a structured breakdown for rebuttal drafting (ICML mapping).
- `stage2/template/SKILL.md`: Shared Stage 2 refine template. Apply before conference overrides.
- `stage2/iclr/SKILL.md`: Refine Stage2 outline drafts into reviewer-facing rebuttal prose.
- `stage2/icml/SKILL.md`: Refine Stage2 outline drafts into reviewer-facing rebuttal prose (ICML labeling).
- `stage4/condense/SKILL.md`: Condense Stage 3 combined discussion into reusable markdown context.
- `stage4/refine/SKILL.md`: Refine follow-up response using condensed context + follow-up question + user draft.
- `stage5/final-remarks/SKILL.md`: Fill Stage 5 final remarks template from all reviewers' condensed markdown context.

## Available utility workflows

- `polish/SKILL.md`: Polish (rephrase) a rebuttal message template for clarity and professionalism while preserving the original structure, tone, and intent.

## Available stage-general utility skills

These skills apply across multiple stages and provide strategic, stylistic, and quality guidance:

- `utility/stage/review-response/SKILL.md`: Comment classification (Major/Minor/Misunderstanding/Typo) and response strategy selection (Accept/Defend/Clarify/Experiment). Use when planning how to respond to any reviewer concern.
- `utility/stage/writing-anti-ai/SKILL.md`: Remove AI-generated writing patterns from rebuttal prose. Use after Stage 2 refinement or Stage 4 follow-up when text reads formulaic or robotic.
- `utility/stage/text-condense/SKILL.md`: Condense selected rebuttal prose into fewer words without changing meaning. Use when a paragraph is too long but the technical content should stay intact.
- `utility/stage/rebuttal-self-review/SKILL.md`: Pre-submission quality checklist covering coverage, tone, factual accuracy, structure, and clarity. Use after Stage 3 compilation or Stage 5 final remarks.
- `utility/stage/citation-verification/SKILL.md`: Verification workflow for any new citation added during rebuttal writing. Use when LLM-suggested references appear in Stage 2 drafts.

If a requested stage/conference does not exist, stop and ask for missing spec before inventing format.
When adding a new conference for Stage 1 or Stage 2, extend the stage template and edit only conference-specific differences.
