## 📖 Introduction

Writing rebuttals for academic conferences is a high-stakes, time-sensitive task. Yet, there is currently **no dedicated editor** that streamlines this process. Researchers often find themselves wrestling with formatting constraints, manually splitting reviewer comments into atomic issues, and juggling multiple response drafts across disorganized documents — all under a tight deadline.

**Rebuttal Studio** was built to change that. It provides a structured, stage-by-stage workflow that guides you through the entire rebuttal process, from parsing reviewer comments to polishing your final responses. By offloading the tedious mechanical work — format conversion, issue segmentation, template management — Rebuttal Studio lets you **focus on the substance of your rebuttal**, which is the part that actually matters.

### 🔄 The Rebuttal Studio Pipeline

Our workflow is organized into **5 stages**:

| Stage | Name | Description |
|:-----:|:-----|:------------|
| **1** | **Breakdown** | Break down reviewer feedback into structured, atomic points — individual weaknesses and questions — making it easy to address every concern systematically. |
| **2** | **Reply** | Draft point-by-point replies to each concern with an outline-first approach. Then refine your outlines into polished, publication-ready paragraphs using LLM-powered skills. |
| **3** | **First Round** | Compile the first-round rebuttal document in the required conference format, ready to submit. |
| **4** | **Multi Rounds** *(Optional)* | Handle follow-up rounds of discussion during the rebuttal period, when reviewers ask for clarifications or raise new concerns. |
| **5** | **Final Remarks** | Finalize and summarize the rebuttal outcome. |

Through this principled pipeline, we aim to help academic researchers **focus on the rebuttal content itself**, rather than getting bogged down by formatting minutiae and the mechanical overhead of organizing responses.

## 🤝 Contributing

**We warmly welcome contributions from everyone!** Whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, improved templates, or better documentation — every contribution makes Rebuttal Studio better for the entire research community.

### Why Contribute?

This project was built from scratch in **a single weekend (~15 hours)** by a solo developer with **zero prior experience** in web design or app development. There is *so much* room for improvement, and we need your help.

### 📝 Technical Report & Authorship

We plan to release a **technical report on arXiv** before the NeurIPS 2026 rebuttal period begins (**Around July, 2026**). Here's our commitment to contributors:

- ✅ **All contributors** whose pull requests are merged into the `master` branch are welcome to **opt in as authors** on the technical report.
- 🌟 **Outstanding contributors** will be additionally recognized and labeled as **Main Contributors**.

We deeply appreciate every contributor's effort — **you deserve this credit**. 🙏

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Short-Term Goals

- [ ] **Robustness** — Improve system resilience to handle diverse input formats and edge cases gracefully.
- [ ] **Multi-Platform API Support** — Extend LLM integration beyond the current setup to support more API providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, local models).
- [x] **More Conference Templates** — ✅ Added built-in support for ICLR, ICML, ARR (ACL, EMNLP), and NeurIPS with complete review rubrics.
- [x] **Higher-Quality Templates** — ✅ Enhanced all conference templates with detailed scoring scales (1-6 ratings, 4-point scales, etc.), interactive "?" tooltips for each metric, and structured section layouts.
- [ ] **Enhanced Stage Skills** — Introduce more specialized skills at each pipeline stage (e.g., tone adjustment, evidence structuring, counter-argument generation) for more professional polishing. *[Partial: Created stage1/stage2 skills for ICLR, ICML, ARR, NeurIPS]*
- [ ] **Additional Venues** — Add more conference templates: EMNLP (standalone), ACL, CVPR, ECCV, NAACL, and others.

### Long-Term Goals

- [ ] **Online Collaborative Platform** — Deploy Rebuttal Studio as a cloud-hosted service with real-time multi-user collaboration, similar to Overleaf.
  > 🤝 *We are actively looking for collaborators to help build this online platform. If you're interested in contributing to this vision, please reach out!*
- [ ] **End-to-End Agent Mode** — Develop an agentic pipeline capable of automating the entire rebuttal workflow.
  > ⚠️ *This is NOT the primary philosophy of Rebuttal Studio. We strongly believe that the author should remain in the driver's seat. The goal of automation is to reduce friction — not to replace the researcher's own critical thinking and domain expertise.*
